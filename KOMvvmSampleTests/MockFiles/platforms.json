These companies included some of the world\u2019s largest electronics companies at the time: Goldstar, Sanyo, Samsung, AT&amp;T, Creative Labs and even Panasonic, which at the time of the 3DO's release was the largest electronic manufacturer. A second part of 3DO\u2019s business strategy was to be extremely liberal when it came to manufacturing the system; the idea was that there would be no designated system specs. This gave manufacturers the freedom to create anything they wanted for any person or audience. In concept it would give consumers more choices as the 3DO would be extremely upgradeable. The idea was to make the 3DO as simple to manufacture as a CD player, while still functioning as a home entertainment system, a PC, a music player, and, most importantly, a video game system. The 3DO would also allow third party developers to push new technology, like wireless and DVD remote-style controllers, as well as numerous multimedia features.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1083968-sanyo3do.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1083968\" data-size=\"large\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.425\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1083968-sanyo3do.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1083968\"><img alt=\"A 3DO of Sanyo manufacturing.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1083968-sanyo3do.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1083968-sanyo3do.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>A 3DO of Sanyo manufacturing.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Trip Hawkins wanted people to see the 3DO as a multimedia unit; however, with an MSRP of $700, audiences everywhere rejected it as an overpriced piece of tech. Consumers also rejected the 3DO due to its lack of quality launch titles. Some of the manufacturers caught on to how the 3DO was being perceived by audiences and attempted to remedy it by manufacturing cheaper versions of the unit. Their attempts were somewhat limited by the fact that the manufactures of the system got paid for systems sold, but not royalties for the game. Later models were priced downward of $500 but by then the damage had already been done, by this time the Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn were entering the market and could do a lot more for a lot less.<\/p><p>The 3DO console debuted in 1993, but with no in-house development and third-party support dwindling, the 3DO was effectively dead by 1997 and in the half-off bins of almost every video game store in America. By the end of the console's life and the bankruptcy of the 3DO company, the console had only sold a measly 2 million units.<\/p><p>The 3DO Company did try to follow up the console with a second video game console design dubbed M2, but this console never made it past the initial design and test system phase, effectively cancelling many titles in development for the system, including the prototype for <a href=\"\/d2\/3030-18898\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18898\">D2<\/a>. The M2 design was eventually sold off to Panasonic\/Matsushita.<\/p><h2>Design<\/h2><p>Despite ultimately being a failure the 3DO featured several notable innovations. While some console manufacturers were still utilizing cartridges, the 3DO embraced the CD format. With special additions, up to 8 players could play cooperatively on a single console. The system also featured an internal memory allowing players to save their game data in the console.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1083971-mb_fz1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1083971\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.54397394136808\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1083971-mb_fz1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1083971\"><img alt=\"Inside a Goldstar 3DO.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px\" data-width=\"307\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1083971-mb_fz1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1083971-mb_fz1.jpg 307w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Inside a Goldstar 3DO.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1083971-mb_fz1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1083971-mb_fz1.jpg 307w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px\" data-width=\"307\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Inside a Goldstar 3DO.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The console had expansion modules which gave owners the ability to turn their console into a media player. However, expansions that allowed owners to play VHS tapes as well as VCDs were either rare and hard to come by or outrageously expensive. Also, the ability to play VHS tapes was a questionable feature mostly due to VCDs becoming more affordable and visually superior.<\/p><p>This again highlights yet another flaw that plagued owners of 3DOs and the console: features that were promised at launch were not a reality. Expansion modules which would have allowed for more RAM or memory never quite came to fruition. In fact, the much requested memory expansion for the unit was only released in Japan and in limited supply in the United States.<\/p><h2>Games and Development Support<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1083973-burning_soldier.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1083973\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1083973-burning_soldier.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1083973\"><img alt=\"3DO version of Burning Soldier.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8273\/1083973-burning_soldier.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1083973-burning_soldier.jpg 376w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8273\/1083973-burning_soldier.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"3DO version of Burning Soldier.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8273\/1083973-burning_soldier.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1083973-burning_soldier.jpg 376w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8273\/1083973-burning_soldier.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>3DO version of Burning Soldier.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Despite being a commercial failure, the 3DO featured an impressive amount of third-party support for its first year.

Also, a certain street racing series called <a href=\"\/need-for-speed\/3025-483\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-483\">Need for Speed<\/a> got its start on the 3DO.

The system was sold bundled with a pair of stereo headphones, a lightgun (a second could be purchased for two-player modes), and the pack-in title: Sonic Fury. The Action Max has an integrated speaker, and LED display which keeps score. No connection between the VHS VCR and the Action Max is required, due to the unique scoring mechanism - a light sensor placed at the corner of the TV tallies \"hits\" and \"friendly fire\". The video from the Action Max tapes have a small area which is usually dark, but turns light to reflect the light-gun's emission to the detector when something \"hittable\" is onscreen. Hits register on the LED display for each player, and hits are deducted for misses (friendly fire). A selector switch would determine one of three play modes, including Standard, Reflex (where one needed to score hits quickly), and Limited Ammo.<\/p><p>Only five tapes were released, though a sixth tape, \"Fright Night\" was filmed, but never released. Mattel released the functionally similar Captain Power the following year, to somewhat more success.<\/p>",

The console is self-contained, and thus no external monitor is needed, and uses game cartridges. As far as the monitor goes, it uses one string of 40 red LEDs and a spinning mirror (just like <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\">Nintendo<\/a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3045-79\" href=\"\/virtual-boy\/3045-79\/\">Virtual Boy<\/a>) instead of an LCD screen, which leads to a resolution of 150 x 40 pixels and an amount of 15 frames per second. That kind of monitor was a huge drawback, as no other console at the time used that techique. Not to mention that the mirror drew a large amount of power from the batteries, although the AC adapter that is built in solves that.<\/p><p>Due to the monitor, only 4 games were released for it.<\/p><h2>Technical Specifications<\/h2><ul><li><b>CPU<\/b>: Intel 8048 running @ 733 KHz<\/li><li><b>Sound:<\/b> National Semiconductor COP411L @ 52.6 KHz<\/li><li><b>RAM:<\/b> 64 bytes (8048-internal), and 1K (on main PCB)<\/li><li><b>ROM:<\/b> 1K (8048-internal), 512 bytes (COP411L-internal) and 4K (game cartridge)<\/li><li><b>Input:<\/b> 4 direction joystick<\/li><li><b>Graphics<\/b>: 150x40 monochrome pixels, running @ 15 FPS<\/li><\/ul>",

Commodore acquired Amiga Corporation in the summer of 1984, snatching the Amiga chipset from under the nose of <a href=\"\/atari\/3010-182\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-182\">Atari<\/a>, who originally funded the project. Commodore filed for bankruptcy in 1994, despite the success of the A1200 and CD32. In 1997, Jeff Schindler founded Amiga, Inc. in South Dakota, which was a subsidiary of Gateway, Inc. which bought the Interlectual Property of Amiga from Escom AG during the same year.<\/p><p>Later in 1999, Gateway, Inc. sold the brand to Bill McEwen and is since then running Amiga, Inc. as a Public company.<\/p><p>Nowadays, Computers running on the Amiga brand are run by the PowerPC architecture and run via the AmigaOS 4 Operating System that is maintained by third party companies.<\/p><h2>Hardware<\/h2><p>The Amiga range was based on the Motorola 68000 chipset, but made use of proprietary graphics and sound co-processors (codenamed Denise and Paula respectively), which took the load off of the CPU and allowed the Amiga to process more than just gaming graphics extremely efficiently. The Amiga revolutionized video production, providing an affordable CG solution with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newtek.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Newtek<\/a> Video Toaster (which later evolved into the Newtek TriCaster, the core of Giant Bomb's video production). It was the first consumer grade computer to be able to sample and record stereo audio in 44.1khz (CD quality) at the time. Over the lifetime of the computer, three graphics and sound chipsets were used: OCS (Original ChipSet), ECS (Enhanced ChipSet) and AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture).<\/p><h2>Classic Amiga Models<\/h2><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Released<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Model<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Codename<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Chipset<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Memory<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Kickstarter<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Variants<\/th><th scope=\"col\">Colours<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td><p>July 23 1985<\/p><\/td><td><p><strong>Amiga 1000<\/strong><\/p><\/td><td>Lorraine<\/td><td><p>OCS<\/p><\/td><td><p>256k onboard, upgradable to 512k<\/p><\/td><td><p>v1.0 - v1.3, on floppy disc<\/p><\/td><td> <\/td><td><p>32 on screen,<\/p><p>4096 palette<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p>March 1987<\/p><\/td><td><p><strong>Amiga 2000<\/strong><\/p><\/td><td><p>The Boss<\/p><\/td><td><p>OCS<\/p><\/td><td><p>1MB onboard, upgradable to 8MB<\/p><\/td><td><p>v1.3 or v2.0, in ROM<\/p><\/td><td><p><strong>A1500<\/strong> - UK only, second floppy instead of hard drive<\/p><p><strong>A2000C <\/strong>- ECS variant<\/p><p><strong>A2500 <\/strong>- Pro variant with 68030 CPU \"accelerator\"<\/p><\/td><td><p>64 on screen,<\/p><p>4096 palette<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p>October 1987<\/p><\/td><td><p><strong>Amiga 500<\/strong><\/p><\/td><td><p>Rock Lobster<\/p><\/td><td><p>OCS<\/p><\/td><td><p>512k onboard, upgradable to 1MB<\/p><\/td><td><p>v1.2 or v1.3, in ROM<\/p><\/td><td><p><strong>A500+<\/strong> - ECS, v2.04, 1MB RAM<\/p><p><strong>CDTV<\/strong> - Hi-fi case and CD-ROM, based on A500+<\/p><\/td><td><p>64 on screen,<\/p><p>4096 palette<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p>June 1990<\/p><\/td><td><p><strong>Amiga 3000<\/strong><\/p><\/td><td><p>B2<\/p><\/td><td><p>ECS<\/p><\/td><td><p>2MB onboard, upgradable to 16MB<\/p><\/td><td><p>v1.3 or v2.0, in ROM<\/p><\/td><td><p><strong>A3000UX<\/strong> - bundled with Unix<\/p><p><strong>A3000T<\/strong> - tower variant<\/p><\/td><td><p>256 on screen,<\/p><p>4096 palette<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p>March 1992<\/p><\/td><td><p><strong>Amiga 600<\/strong><\/p><\/td><td><p>Junebug<\/p><\/td><td><p>ECS<\/p><\/td><td><p>1MB onboard, upgradable to 2MB<\/p><\/td><td><p>v2.05, in ROM<\/p><\/td><td><p><strong>A600HD<\/strong> - included 20MB or 40MB hard drive<\/p><\/td><td><p>64 on screen,<\/p><p>4096 palette<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p>September 1992<\/p><\/td><td><p><strong>Amiga 4000<\/strong><\/p><\/td><td><p>Pandora<\/p><\/td><td><p>AGA<\/p><\/td><td><p>2MB onboard, upgradable to 16MB<\/p><\/td><td><p>v3.0, in ROM<\/p><\/td><td><p><strong>A4000T<\/strong> - Tower case, 68040 CPU<\/p><\/td><td><p>4096 on screen,<\/p><p>262,144 palette<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p>October 1992<\/p><\/td><td><p><strong>Amiga 1200<\/strong><\/p><\/td><td><p>Channel Z<\/p><\/td><td><p>AGA<\/p><\/td><td><p>2MB onboard, upgradable to 8MB<\/p><\/td><td><p>v3.0, in ROM<\/p><\/td><td><p><strong>CD32<\/strong> - Console variant.

            "description": "<p>The Amiga CD32 was released in September 1993, and it was the first 32-bit cd-rom console to be released in <a href=\"\/europe\/3035-289\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-289\"> Europe<\/a> and <a href=\"\/canada\/3035-244\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-244\"> Canada<\/a>. Although the plans for releasing it in the US never happened. The Amiga had similar specs as the Amiga 1200 and had the possibility to add mouse, keyboard, etc. It also had a covered expansion slot intended to accomodate a VideoCD playback module. This was eventually utilized by third parties to create other expansion modules that allowed the CD32 to act as a fully capable Amiga computer, first by adding missing ports and later providing for the ability to add a hard drive, memory and upgrade the CPU. The console lasted only for approximately seven months due to component supply issues and therefore it didn't have the sales impact to keep the console alive.<\/p><p>However, the console was kept alive in other forms: In the late 1990s to early 2000s, slot machine manufacturer StarGames utilized a stripped down CD32 motherboard in many of their slot machines and in the mid to late 1990s, some vehicle registries in Canada utilized CD32 systems for interactive multimedia testing for drivers license applications.<\/p><p>The CD32 also had a unique piece of hardware called the Akiko chip that was added specifically to enable the console to more easily support \"Doom clones\". It provided acceleration for converting the PC's chunky pixel format (which was better suited to the routines that generated the graphics in Doom-like games) to the Amiga's planar pixel format.<\/p><h2>Technical Specifications<\/h2><table data-max-width=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Processor<\/strong><\/td><td>Motorola 68EC020 @ 14.32 MHz (NTSC) or 14.18 MHz (PAL)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>RAM<\/strong><\/td><td>2 MB Amiga Chip RAM<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>ROM<\/strong><\/td><td>1 MB Kickstart w\/ CD32 firmware<br \/>1 KB EEPROM for game saves<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics<\/strong><\/td><td><p>Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA)<\/p><p>Akiko chip<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Sound<\/strong><\/td><td>4 x 8-bit PCM channels<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Screen Resolution<\/strong><\/td><td>320x200 to 1280x400i (NSTC)<br \/>320x256 to 1280x512i (PAL)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong> Operating System<\/strong><\/td><td>AmigaOS 3.1<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>",

A Spanish law required that every computer with up to 64KB should have extra keys for the Spanish language, or an extra tax would be levied. So Amstrad soldered in an extra 8KB which was not, however, usable by the machine since it was not connected to anything else. Later on Amstrad released a 472 with a proper Spanish keyboard. After the rule changed there was also a CPC 472 with non-Spanish keys available for a very short time. Today, the CPC 472 is very rare.<\/p><h2>CPC 664<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1270\/815412-cpc664.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-815412\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.67428571428571\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1270\/815412-cpc664.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-815412\"><img alt=\"CPC 664\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1270\/815412-cpc664.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1270\/815412-cpc664.jpg 350w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/1270\/815412-cpc664.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>CPC 664<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Released in In June 1985, the CPC 664 is essentialy the same hardware as the previous CPC 464 with a floppy disc drive taking the place of the cassette drive and a new easier to type keyboard.<\/p><h2>CPC 6128<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1270\/815415-cpc6128.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-815415\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.7\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1270\/815415-cpc6128.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-815415\"><img alt=\"CPC 6128\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" data-width=\"210\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1270\/815415-cpc6128.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1270\/815415-cpc6128.jpg 210w\"><noscript><img alt=\"CPC 6128\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1270\/815415-cpc6128.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/1270\/815415-cpc6128.jpg 210w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px\" data-width=\"210\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>CPC 6128<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Amstrad launched the CPC 6128 shortly after the CPC 664 for the American market .

The CPC name is said to have been dropped because of a legal dispute with a French firm, though it is also likely that \"CPC 6128 Plus\" was considered too unwieldy a name and one redolent of the machine's mid-80s heritage.<\/p><p>Described as a solution of <em>\"too little, too late\"<\/em>, this was Amstrad's second effort to prolong the life of its 8-bit computer series in the face of fierce competition from new 16-bit machines (notably, the <a href=\"\/atari-st\/3045-13\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-13\">Atari ST<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/amiga\/3045-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Commodore Amiga<\/a>). The Plus series were mostly (but not quite 100%) compatible with the original CPC computers, and incorporated a list of new features, like a cartridge port for instant program loading, DMA for the AY soundchip, hardware scrolling, programmable interrupts, 16 hardware zoomable sprites (not vectorized) with an independent palette of 15 colours, and a choice of 4096 colours all in a new, sleek case which mimicked the keyboard-computer design that was <em>en vogue<\/em> in the 16-bit market (ST, Amiga etc). While the Amstrad Plus computers were arguably one of the best 8-bit computers ever built for the mass market, they died an early death as the 16-bit era had well and truly begun.<\/p>",

            "description": "<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>Android is an operating system designed by Google and that can be found on multiple devices. The OS is found on a variety of devices from a variety of manufacturers in various form factors. It is most commonly seen on smartphones and tablets.<\/p><h4>Design and Front End Features<\/h4><p>Matias Duarte, an ex-Danger Software designer (Danger being known for making the Sidekick phone) and Palm phone software designer, joined Google's Android design team in 2010. With his lead, the team has implemented its unique Android design language and a theme called Holo, with a focus on clean, line based design, and a signature 'holo' blue accent color.<\/p><p>In May of 2012, the Android team declared a 'war on lag', and introduced the hardware accelerated feature dubbed 'Project Butter', aiming to be much faster than the previous Android 4.0. In update 4.2, Google introduced lockscreen widgets. Allowing users to pin a specific widget to the lock screen, that can be swiped away for more widgets, pressing on a prompt within the lockscreen would unlock the device and automatically go to the same app of the specific widget.<\/p><h2>Technical Features<\/h2><p>Android is an open source OS based on <a href=\"\/linux\/3045-152\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-152\">Linux<\/a> and ARM architecture. The Android was designed with Google specific applications in mind. It usually runs any application or service that associated with Google (Gmail, Google Maps, Google Search, Google Talk, Google Translate, YouTube, etc.). It also possesses functionality for GPS and accelerometers. The latest version available is 4.4 (KitKat). Future versions will retain the confectionery\/dessert naming motif.<\/p><h2>Homescreen<\/h2><p>The home screen is extremely customizable. The OS comes originally with 5 screens. Much like Apple's iOS, users can put different applications and shortcuts on this screen, however the Android gives more options for customization. Above and beyond this, the open OS allows for third party developers to release their own home homescreen launchers to suit the needs of the individual. Popular home screen replacements include Go Launcher, LauncherPro, and Nova Launcher.<\/p><p>Applications and shortcuts can be placed anywhere on the home screen. These widgets allow users to browse an app without actually opening it. For example, users can browse status upgrades on Facebook or go directly into Google Search from the home screen. Android also supports moving backgrounds, known as live wallpapers, that can either respond to touch, time of day, or move to music.<\/p><h2>Google Play<\/h2><p>Launched in October of 2008 as Android Market, Google Play is Google's distribution channel for apps, books, music and movies. The store features over 500,000 apps and games. Apps can be found by browsing categories or searching. Within each category there are multiple screens listing the most popular free and paid apps, popular new apps, and currently trending apps. Some categories have contain further categories that can be browsed.<\/p><p>To distribute apps on the Google Play Store developers must register for the Google Play developer and pay a one-time fee of US$25. Developers make 70% of a profit from the app, while the last 30% go to Google. The is not a strict approval process. Once a new or updated app passes an automatic malware detection process, it will go live after a few hours. Applications which violate Google Play policies are reported to Google by the Play Store's users and.<\/p><p>Unlike the App Store on iOS, it is not required to distribute through the Play Store. Developers may elect to distribute though other stores such as the Amazon Appstore, or handle distribution themselves. However, app stores themselves may not be distributed via the Play Store per the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement's non-compete clause.<\/p><p>On March 6, 2012, Google re-branded the Android Market to \"Play Store\" as per their shift of focus to include all of their download services into one concept, Google Play.<\/p><h2>Android Open Source Project<\/h2><p>Google releases Android's source code through the <a href=\"http:\/\/source.android.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Android Open Source Project<\/a>, where it is then available for use by device manufacturers and hobbyists to create their own versions. In order for a derivative of Android to be allowed to call itself Android, it must comply with the Compatibility Definition Document. The CDD details the many things that must not be changed and what is permitted to be changed to meet compatibility requirements. Among other things, compatible devices must be able to correctly run the game <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/replica-island\/3030-43848\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-43848\">Replica Island<\/a>. Devices that do not meet these requirements cannot be marketed as Android and will not be distributed with the suite of Google applications. AOSP-derived products that have chosen not to meet Android's compatibility requirements include the Kindle Fire and the <a href=\"\/ouya\/3045-154\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-154\">Ouya<\/a>.<\/p><p>The source code for Honeycomb (3.x) was not released to AOSP until the release of the Ice Cream Sandwich code.<\/p>",

His previous experience with the game <a href=\"\/breakout\/3030-13049\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13049\">Breakout<\/a> on the <a href=\"\/atari-2600\/3045-40\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-40\">Atari 2600<\/a> motivated Wozniak to essentially ensure the Apple ][ could be a great gaming machine. After Wozniak set up the new computer to display in color, he naturally continued on to add sound and then paddle control to the Apple ][. The Apple ][ was now a full blown gaming machine.<\/p><p>Though the designs of the Apple-1 and later the Apple ][ were basically Steve Wozniak's efforts alone, <a href=\"\/steve-jobs\/3040-9951\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-9951\">Steve Jobs<\/a> played a very important role in establishing the visual appearance of the Apple ][. While Wozniak wouldn't think twice about extra wires hanging about on a computer that worked, Jobs knew how to make an appealing package for people outside the once very niche computer enthusiast group. The Apple ][ was made to look quite different from other similar machines on the market. It had a much more user-friendly aesthetic. It almost looked like a <a href=\"\/typewriter\/3055-524\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-524\">typewriter<\/a> but at the same time was \"futuristic\" enough to clearly be seen as a computer. The case was user-friendly as well. It was easily removable which was rare at the time. Most similar devices warned against any type of self-service and didn't welcome exploration.<\/p><h2>The Apple ][ and Gaming<\/h2><p>Since Steve Wozniak designed the Apple ][ to be a gaming machine, it ended up being really successful as one.

One of the most important games to come from the Apple ][ early on though was a game called <a href=\"\/mystery-house\/3030-2744\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2744\">Mystery House<\/a>. This was the first adventure style game to feature graphics of any kind. all previous games of this style were purely <a href=\"\/text-based\/3015-2199\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2199\">text based<\/a>. A worthwhile side note is that Mystery House was created by <a href=\"\/ken-williams\/3040-928\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-928\">Ken<\/a> and <a href=\"\/roberta-williams\/3040-2073\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-2073\">Roberta Williams<\/a> who went on to start the company <a href=\"\/sierra-entertainment-inc\/3010-1030\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1030\">Sierra Entertainment, Inc.<\/a> As previously mentioned, there were many ports of games that came to the Apple ][.

This resulted in larger games being shipped on multiple, more expensive double-sided diskettes, and because there was no hard drive to install the software on to it, prompts would appear instructing the user when to swap or flip the diskettes to continue.<\/p><p>Even though the graphics were often pared down as the Apple ][ became older, it still provided Apple owners with roughly the same experience of these games. The Apple ][, along with machines like the <a href=\"\/amiga\/3045-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Amiga<\/a>, the <a href=\"\/atari-8-bit\/3045-24\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-24\">Atari 400 and 800<\/a>, and the <a href=\"\/commodore-64\/3045-14\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64<\/a> (to an extent), single-handedly drove the microcomputer gaming era beginning in the late 70s.<\/p><h2>Hardware Details<\/h2><p>The Apple ][ was a very versatile computer in terms of hardware <i>and<\/i> software. The Apple ][ was actually the leader as a platform for launching new and unique hardware gadgets for quite some time after its initial launch in 1977. The popularity of the Apple ][ series kept it on the cutting edge of hardware\/peripheral development until about 1991. That's nearly 15 years of hardware development for a single platform. Standard hardware components were included the Apple ][, such as keyboard, RAM, CPU, etc. The first Apple ][ models were built and shipped with 4K of memory, upgradable via expansion ports up to 48K. The Apple ]['s various expansion ports proved very useful for the many possible hardware upgrades to come in the future.<\/p><p>Hardware expansions were very common despite not always being very compatible or universal. Some of the general \"upgrades\" one could purchase and install included:<\/p><ul><li>Interface Cards<\/li><li>Video Cards<\/li><li>ROM\/RAM expansion cards<\/li><li>Co-Processors<\/li><li>Accelerators<\/li><li>Printers<\/li><li>Alternate Input Devices (joysticks, paddles, etc.)<\/li><\/ul><p>The earliest Apple ][ keyboards are notable for not having a CAPS LOCK key, because the system typeface included in ROM had no lower-case letters. Graphical fonts could be used by applications to overcome this limitation, as the keyboard did have a Shift function for typing symbols placed above the number row.<\/p><p>The Apple logo on the case was emblazoned with a rainbow of stripes to signify the system's ability to produce color. Display monitors sold with the Apple ][ were generally monochrome, commonly in green or amber. The video capabilities of the system, however, were based on the NTSC video standard. Hooking up a normal household television to the computer would allow for compatible games and applications to display in a small but variable color palette, depending on the video mode used and the technique of signal modulation.<\/p><h2>Hardware Evolution and New Models<\/h2><h3>Apple ][ Plus<\/h3><figure style=\"width: 440px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1296890-apple3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296890\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"440\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1296890-apple3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296890\"><img alt=\"The Apple II Plus\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1296890-apple3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1296890-apple3.jpg 440w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1296890-apple3.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Apple II Plus\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1296890-apple3.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1296890-apple3.jpg 440w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1296890-apple3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Apple II Plus<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Apple ][ Plus hardware was introduced to market in June 1979. Upgraded features included a ROM-integrated version of the Applesoft II BASIC programming language (supplied by Microsoft), and a much larger 48K bank of RAM now expandable to 64K.<\/p><p>The inclusion of the BASIC programming language in every model sold, rather than having to purchase it separately, provided a greater opportunity for every end user to explore programming and naturally game development on the system. Computer enthusiast magazines of this era would often include several pages of BASIC code that a user would painstakingly type in by hand, to run various utility or entertainment programs, some even including primitive graphics. In the event of an error in the printed code, a user could attempt debugging, or simply wait for the next magazine issue to print a correction.<\/p>",

Production ended just 4 months later in October 1983. <br\/><br\/>The system as a computer had little to no built in memory so when using the cartridge \"Fileform\" (a word processor) the user would have to store their work often on tape or print it out on paper, Eventually releasing several RAM memory expansions, All of which were quite costly. Mattel admitted that they released the Aquarius at a loss with the expectation that they would earn a profit by selling the extension modules and cartridges that were used for each different program.<br\/>\u00a0<br\/>As a console it fared no better. The graphics were comparable to that of the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-51\" href=\"\/intellivision\/3045-51\/\" slug=\"intellivision\"> Intellivision<\/a>, and used the exact same sound card as the Intellivision, which also had a far greater selection of games to choose from. <br\/>\u00a0<br\/>Programmers jokingly used the line \"Aquarius - system for the seventies!\" <br\/>\u00a0 <br\/><h2>Hardware<br\/><\/h2>The Aquarius had several extension modules, Used to make gaming an easier more enjoyable experience, Though they were costly and did little to help create a market for the device.\u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0<br\/><h3>Mini Expander<br\/><\/h3>\u00a0Added an additional cartridge slot, Allowing a game cartridge and memory cartridge to be attached at the same time.

However, over time, the word is mostly recognized today as a place to play video games and have fun. This was mainly because designer cabinets with screens inside them would provide games that people can enjoy. They would become known as Video Game Arcade machines.<\/p><p>Throughout the late 20th century, arcade machines were known for having the most cutting-edge technology in gaming, with superior graphics and audio capabilities than both home consoles and <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">personal computers<\/a>, as well as controls and peripherals not possible (or very expensive) on home machines. In the early 21st century, however, arcades were surpassed by the <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a> platform in terms of graphics, and by home consoles in terms of popularity.

By the mid-1980s, the popularity of arcade games declined further with the release of <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo<\/a>'s sequel to arcade game <a href=\"\/mario-bros\/3030-19726\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19726\">Mario Bros<\/a>, called <a href=\"\/super-mario-bros\/3030-15544\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\">Super Mario Bros<\/a>, which became a phenomenon and would put home consoles on the map. The <a href=\"\/nes\/3045-21\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES<\/a>'s rising popularity slowly began to rival the arcade's dominance over the gaming industry. After Super Mario Bros made a killing on Nintendo's own console, a special arcade version named <a href=\"\/vs-super-mario-bros\/3030-25222\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25222\">VS: Super Mario Bros<\/a> appeared in the arcades. This version had levels that were different and more challenging than the console version. Since then, video game developers released innovative and fun video games in arcades that would create a lasting effect for over a decade in the United States.<\/p><p>In 1985, <a href=\"\/yu-suzuki\/3040-15149\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-15149\">Yu Suzuki<\/a> and his <a href=\"\/sega-am2\/3010-81\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-81\">Sega AM2<\/a> team revitalized the arcade industry with <a href=\"\/hang-on\/3030-11570\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11570\">Hang-On<\/a>, which introduced features that could not be replicated on home systems: advanced graphics (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/25d\/3015-660\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-660\">pseudo-3D<\/a>, \"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/super-scaler\/3015-8389\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8389\">Super Scaler<\/a>\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/sprite-scaling\/3015-7122\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7122\">sprite-scaling<\/a>), and more importantly, a motion-controlled <a href=\"http:\/\/www.1up.com\/features\/disappearance-suzuki-part-1?pager.offset=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">hydraulic motorbike cabinet<\/a>, introducing full-body <a href=\"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/motion-control\/3015-474\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-474\">motion control<\/a>.

Many of the best-selling home video games in the early 1990's were also often arcade ports. During this era, developers like <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega<\/a>, <a href=\"\/namco-bandai-games-inc\/3010-382\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-382\">Namco<\/a>, <a href=\"\/midway-games\/3010-185\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-185\">Midway<\/a>, <a href=\"\/capcom\/3010-367\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom<\/a> and <a href=\"\/konami-corporation\/3010-87\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami<\/a> became household names because of their great arcade games.<\/p><p><a href=\"\/polygonal-3d\/3015-1430\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">3D polygon graphics<\/a> became increasingly popular during this era due to developers pushing the boundaries of early 3D graphics technology in the arcades, most notably Sega and Namco, with games like <a href=\"\/virtua-racing\/3025-1300\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1300\">Virtua Racing<\/a> (which popularized 3D polygon graphics), <a href=\"\/ridge-racer\/3030-2158\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2158\">Ridge Racer<\/a> (which introduced texture-mapped 3D polygons), <a href=\"\/daytona-usa\/3025-134\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-134\">Daytona USA<\/a> (which introduced 3D texture filtering), <a href=\"\/rave-racer\/3030-23244\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23244\">Rave Racer<\/a> (which introduced hi-res texture mapping), and the <a href=\"\/virtua-fighter\/3025-231\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-231\">Virtua Fighter<\/a> series (the <a href=\"\/virtua-fighter\/3030-15584\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15584\">first game<\/a> introduced relatively detailed 3D <a href=\"\/human\/3015-810\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-810\">human<\/a> characters, with the <a href=\"\/virtua-fighter-2\/3030-41\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41\">second<\/a> and <a href=\"\/virtua-fighter-3\/3030-19766\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19766\">third <\/a>games further pushing the boundaries of 3D graphical realism).<\/p><p>In the 1990's, arcade video games became so big that you had developers making hit games based off of movies, cartoons, comics, and television shows. Sports games using authentic sports licenses were also made and became quite popular. This, along with inflation, would result in prices for play going up. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, most arcade games cost a quarter per play. However, this soon changed to fifty cents, seventy-five cents, and some games were even a full dollar for first play. At the time people didn't mind because the arcade was also known as the place to see and enjoy the latest graphics, audio and controls in video gaming. Even though the console market made a solid foundation in the homes of millions of Americans, most of them knew that the graphics, audio and controls in their chosen console didn't match the superior ones found in the arcade cabinets. Despite ports of popular arcade games hitting consoles, gamers knew they were getting a watered down version of the original.<\/p><h2>The Downfall of Arcades in North America<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8153\/924824-street_fighter_alpha_anthology_20060612044731274_000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-924824\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8153\/924824-street_fighter_alpha_anthology_20060612044731274_000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-924824\"><img alt=\"Street Fighter Alpha.

Example of a 2D arcade game perfectly ported to 32-bit consoles.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The success of arcade games began to change for the worse in the late 1990's when <a href=\"\/polygonal-3d\/3015-1430\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">3D<\/a> and <a href=\"\/compact-disc\/3055-2133\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2133\">CD<\/a>-based console gaming start becoming popular. This began with the arrival of the 32-bit consoles, the <a href=\"\/saturn\/3045-42\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-42\">Saturn<\/a> and <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation<\/a>. Because of their ability to produce 3D graphics, improved capability in <a href=\"\/2d\/3015-1427\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1427\">2D<\/a> graphics, and the compact disc ability to carry a lot of data, developers were finally able to make good ports of their games to sell on consoles. Business is business, and the developers saw where they could make a lot more money porting near-flawless copies of their games to popular gaming consoles. Because of this, gamers no longer felt they needed to spend money in the arcades to play the latest eye candy, as they could simply go to the store or mall and buy a decent port of the full game for their console.<\/p><p>However, while 32-bit consoles could produce 2D graphics on par with arcades, the arcades still remained competitive in the mid-to-late 1990s by pushing the boundaries of 3D graphics considerably beyond what consoles or <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a>'s were capable of, particularly when it came to powerful arcade machines like <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/daytona-usa\/3030-22135\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22135\">Model 2<\/a> (released 1993) and <a href=\"\/virtua-fighter-3\/3030-19766\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19766\">Model 3<\/a> (released 1996) or <a href=\"\/namco\/3010-7420\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7420\">Namco<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/ridge-racer\/3025-396\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-396\">System 22<\/a> (released 1993) and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.system16.com\/hardware.php?id=539\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">System 23<\/a> (released 1997). However, this changed in 1998, when Sega's <a href=\"\/dreamcast\/3045-37\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-37\">Dreamcast<\/a> became the first home system to produce 3D graphics almost on-par with arcade machines at the time, due to being based on the Sega Naomi arcade hardware (though with half the RAM).

Many Japanese children as well as adults all go to huge and loud arcade places, that usually have sit down machines. As a result, many major and minor developers are still able to make games and turn a profit releasing those games in Japan. Many of these arcade games usually get ported over to the United States and release on the consoles. As of today, many video game developers are now making arcade games using modern <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a> hardware (whereas before, console and PC hardware were often based on arcade machines), making sure the legacy lives on forever.<\/p><p>In recent years, the economic recession, along with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2008\/05\/18\/business\/worldbusiness\/18iht-arcades.1.12985638.html?_r=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">competition<\/a> from the <a href=\"\/wii\/3045-36\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii<\/a> (which introduced arcade-like <a href=\"\/motion-control\/3015-474\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-474\">motion controls<\/a> to homes), has affected the Japanese arcade industry, which has been slowly declining after hitting its peak in the mid-2000's. However, consoles have also begun declining in Japan due to the rise of handhelds and mobile gaming (with Japan having the largest handheld and mobile gaming markets in the world).<\/p><p>Arcade machines are currently thriving in other emerging markets in <a href=\"\/asia\/3035-1663\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1663\">Asia<\/a>, particularly in <a href=\"\/south-korea\/3035-2410\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2410\">South Korea<\/a> and especially <a href=\"\/china\/3035-343\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-343\">China<\/a>, where arcades are widespread across the country; in China's case, this may be partly due to a ban on video game consoles by the Chinese government, which did not lift the console ban until 2013.<\/p><p>Due to the arcade's continued relevance in Asia, many technologies continued to be released for arcades before appearing on consoles.

The most common a style of arcade cabinet in North America is the standard upright cabinet. These cabinets tend to be large and heavy due to there inefficient use of space inside the machine and use of heavy materials such a MDF and metal. Upright cabinets are often six feet tall and take up no more than three feet in width. Normally someone would have to stand to operate the cabinet, or sit on a tall bar stool.The control options for upright arcade cabinets vary from game to game, but commonly contain joysticks, buttons, trackballs, and spinners.<\/p><p>Also common in North America is the counter-top cabinets. This are cabinets that sit on top of something, like a bar or table to raise them up to playing height. Counter-top cabinets are popular because they save needed floor space and are less intrusive than a full sized cabinet. Although any game or control scheme could be made to work on a counter-top cabinet, they are most popular with touch screen trivia games in bars or pubs.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1679149-37182835_7085aa95c7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1679149\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.666\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1679149-37182835_7085aa95c7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1679149\"><img alt=\"Popular Cocktail Cabinet War Lords.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/121177\/1679149-37182835_7085aa95c7.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1679149-37182835_7085aa95c7.jpg 500w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/121177\/1679149-37182835_7085aa95c7.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/121177\/1679149-37182835_7085aa95c7.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Popular Cocktail Cabinet War Lords.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/121177\/1679149-37182835_7085aa95c7.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1679149-37182835_7085aa95c7.jpg 500w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/121177\/1679149-37182835_7085aa95c7.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/121177\/1679149-37182835_7085aa95c7.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Popular Cocktail Cabinet War Lords.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Cocktail Cabinets are low to the ground, table like cabinets.

Additionally, Atari offered several other input devices.<a href=\"\/atari-paddle-controllers\/3000-88\/\" data-ref-id=\"3000-88\"> Paddle controllers<\/a>, consisting of an analogue wheel and a side-mounted button were appropriate for games requiring precise motion on one axis, such as <a href=\"\/kaboom\/3030-9094\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9094\">Kaboom!<\/a> and <a href=\"\/breakout\/3030-13049\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13049\">Breakout<\/a>. <a href=\"\/atari-keypad\/3000-91\/\" data-ref-id=\"3000-91\">Keypad controllers<\/a> feature 12 buttons, and can slide-lock into one another. Overlays exist for a few titles (most notably, <a href=\"\/star-raiders\/3030-730\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-730\">Star Raiders<\/a>) which sit atop the keypad controllers. Other, game specific controllers were also offered, such as the <a href=\"\/atari-driving-controller\/3000-89\/\" data-ref-id=\"3000-89\">driving controller<\/a>; a paddle variant with 360 degree motion, and a <a href=\"\/light-gun\/3015-2354\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2354\">light gun<\/a>. Third-party hardware manufacturers also offered several controllers.<\/p><h2>Hardware Design<\/h2><p>During the initial development of the system concerns regarding the system's cost to manufacture and at retail would lead to a remarkable hardware design. This is turn influenced how software would be written for the system. Despite the system using a version of the popular 6502 processor (which drove many computers and consoles at the time) the processor interfaced with with display in a unique and distinct manner through the use of the Television Interface Adapter (TIA). The consequence of this design choice forced programmers for the 2600 to ensure that each individual line of each frame of the television picture was ready as the electron gun starts to light it up as it travels down the screen. <\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Launch titles<\/h2><h3>United States<\/h3><p>The Atari 2600 launched along with the following 9 games in October 1977:<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1415321\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/73970\/1415321-combat_us_front.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3477088948787\" data-width=\"742\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 742px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/73970\/1415321-combat_us_front.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1415321\"><img alt=\"Combat\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/73970\/1415321-combat_us_front.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/7\/73970\/1415321-combat_us_front.jpg 742w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/7\/73970\/1415321-combat_us_front.jpg 712w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/7\/73970\/1415321-combat_us_front.jpg 474w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" data-width=\"474\"><\/a><figcaption>Combat<\/figcaption><\/figure><ul><li><a href=\"\/air-sea-battle\/3030-5348\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5348\">Air-Sea Battle<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/basic-math\/3030-19476\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19476\">Basic Math<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/blackjack\/3030-23773\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23773\">Blackjack<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/combat\/3030-5368\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5368\">Combat<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/indy-500\/3030-19945\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19945\">Indy 500<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/star-ship\/3030-13503\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13503\">Star Ship<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/video-olympics\/3030-3294\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3294\">Video Olympics (pong)<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/surround\/3030-16028\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16028\">Surround<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/street-racer\/3030-1811\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1811\">Street Racer<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h2>Video Game Market Crash of 1983<\/h2><p>In 1983, the video game market was going into a decline. Atari was getting hit the hardest by this crash- after all, this nightmare was caused partially by Atari itself. The main problem with the 2600 at this time was that its game lineup became overcrowded with bad games. This was mostly because Atari had placed no limitations on who could develop games and how many games could be put out in years or even financial quarters, which is now a mainstay in the video game business first implemented by companies like <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">SEGA<\/a> and <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo<\/a>. This was around the time that <a href=\"\/activision\/3010-78\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\">Activision<\/a> broke off from Atari for more developmental freedom, becoming the first third-party publisher. During 1983, the market was saturated with hundreds of games, with most of them being of poor quality. Since anyone could make games for the Atari 2600, there were all kinds of companies making games who had no place doing so: i.e. cereal and dog food companies, which people would buy and get a refund for later or just ignore. With limited shelf space, retail outlets would eventually stop ordering new software while underselling older products just to make some shelf space. Games were heading into bargain bins, and the games market was going with them.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316516\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/26\/316516-et2600box.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3766666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/26\/316516-et2600box.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-316516\"><img alt=\"E.T for the Atari 2600 was a massive financial failure\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\" data-width=\"464\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/26\/316516-et2600box.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/26\/316516-et2600box.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/26\/316516-et2600box.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/26\/316516-et2600box.jpg 464w\"><noscript><img alt=\"E.T for the Atari 2600 was a massive financial failure\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/26\/316516-et2600box.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/26\/316516-et2600box.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/26\/316516-et2600box.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/26\/316516-et2600box.jpg 464w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\" data-width=\"464\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>E.T for the Atari 2600 was a massive financial failure<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Two games are often the scapegoats of The Great Games Crash of 1983: the Atari 2600 version of <a href=\"\/pac-man\/3030-7624\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7624\">Pac-Man<\/a> and <a href=\"\/et-the-extra-terrestrial\/3030-21595\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21595\">E.T.<\/a>. Atari decided to get the exclusive rights to port <a href=\"\/pac-man\/3030-7624\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7624\">Pac-Man<\/a> (the most popular arcade game during the time) to the Atari 2600. This idea looked excellent on paper, but in practice was a dismal failure. The final release of <a href=\"\/pac-man\/3030-7624\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7624\">Pac-Man<\/a> for the Atari 2600 VCS barely resembled what the <a href=\"\/arcade\/3045-84\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade<\/a> version was. It was ugly, barely played, and had a sound that would likely haunt your mind to this day if you'd hear it. This version was actually a prototype-a proof of concept with no polish and little developmental time, yet was released anyways. In a rash assumption, Atari printed up more copies than there were Ataris owned, assuming the game would sell systems. The result could not have been more disastrous. Very few copies were sold and Atari was stuck in an awkward financial situation. <a href=\"\/et-the-extra-terrestrial\/3030-21595\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21595\">E.T.<\/a> was its own disaster. The same sort of hubris occurred and Atari, so sure of itself, pressed too many copies once more. However, the game was of such poor quality that many sold copies of <a href=\"\/et-the-extra-terrestrial\/3030-21595\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21595\">E.T.<\/a> were returned and refunded. This was such a disaster that it was more cost effective for Atari to simply bury all the copies in a landfill in New Mexico (this was once thought to be only a rumor, but has proven to be true). Atari never truly recovered from this shock.<\/p>",

Still enjoying the massive success from their last home console, the <a href=\"\/atari-2600\/3045-40\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-40\">Atari 2600<\/a>, Atari decided to produce a game system based on its popular line of <a href=\"\/atari-8-bit\/3045-24\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-24\">8-bit computers<\/a>, which were also quickly becoming a popular gaming platform. Games could be ported very easily from the Atari 400\/800 line of computers to the Atari 5200. In the eyes of Atari management, this would encourage third-party development for the 5200 system as their 8-bit computers already had a dedicated group of developers. However the design for various parts of the 5200 would not only differentiate the console from Atari's own product line (Atari 2600, Atari400\/800) but would also differentiate itself from its home console competition ( <a href=\"\/intellivision\/3045-51\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-51\">Intellivision<\/a>\/ <a href=\"\/colecovision\/3045-47\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-47\">ColecoVision<\/a>).<\/p><h2>Hardware<\/h2><p>The largest difference between the 5200 from Atari's 8-bit computers and 2600 is the unique analog joystick. The controller allows for full 360-degree movement. Additionally, it has a second firing button and a keypad. The joystick does not self-center and is therefore prone to getting stuck, making it more difficult to play particular games such as <a href=\"\/asteroids\/3030-1034\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1034\">Asteroids<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1081897-5200_controller_intro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1081897\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0228310502283\" data-width=\"219\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 219px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1081897-5200_controller_intro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1081897\"><img alt=\"The infamous 5200 controller\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1081897-5200_controller_intro.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1081897-5200_controller_intro.jpg 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 219px) 100vw, 219px\" data-width=\"219\"><\/a><figcaption>The infamous 5200 controller<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The 5200's keypad holds overlays, similar to the Intellivision's controller. Many Atari 5200 games came packed with overlays, as did third party games from <a href=\"\/activision\/3010-78\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\">Activision<\/a> and CBS, while Parker Brothers packed only Frogger with an overlay. Brands other than CBS include an overlay holder on the cartridge back. Another innovative feature of the 5200 controllers was the inclusion of a pause button, making it one of the first consoles to allow users to pause the action at any point.<\/p><p>The controllers were prone to failure. This led to several third-party vendors (most notably Wico) to release third-party controllers of varying quality and devices that would allow the use of the 9-pin 2600 joysticks on the 5200.<\/p><p>Later, Atari would release a <a href=\"\/trackball\/3015-2672\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2672\">trackball<\/a>-based controller, akin to the <a href=\"\/marble-madness\/3030-9566\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9566\">Marble Madness<\/a> arcade controller. Reception for this controller (officially called the Trak-Ball Controller), like the console itself, was lukewarm. The controller was as big as the console and was inconsistent in tracking movement. Atari later released a redesigned trackball controller with better motion detection and a more compact design, but by that time the 5200 had already failed to captivate audiences.<\/p><p>The original 5200 also came with a unique RF switch box that supplied power to the 5200 on the same cable that fed audio and video to the television. It reduced the number of cables running across users' floors, but was more expensive to manufacture and replace. The 5200 was incompatible with alternative adapters, making replacements harder to find. Atari later released a redesigned second generation 5200 system that was compatible with any normal power supply and RF switch box. The second generation 5200 had two joystick ports, unlike the original that had four (like the Atari 800 computer).<\/p><h2>The Games<\/h2><p>Far fewer games were released for the 5200 than that of competing consoles from <a href=\"\/\">Intellivision<\/a> and <a href=\"\/\">ColecoVision<\/a>. Few third-party game developers adopted the console because the 2600 already had 20 million users while the 5200 struggled to maintain 1 million users. Also development for the 2600 was cheaper and didn't require newer technology. The few games that were released for the 5200 were mostly designed or produced in-house by Atari. The console's short life span, due in part to the infamous game crash of 1984, curbed further growth of the console's game library.<\/p><h2>Reception and Market Failure<\/h2><p>The Atari 5200 was not well received by consumers when it was released and was never able to completely recover from its lukewarm reception. Various design and technical flaws, which ranged from an unreliable controller to an unusual RF adapter, discouraged users from adopting the console. The first wave of 5200s were also incompatible with 2600 games, requiring users to buy a separate adapter to play their back catalog of 2600 games. Atari officially announced the system was discontinued in 1984 upon the announcement of the <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/atari-7800\/3045-70\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-70\">7800 <\/a>(which would not be released until two years later)<\/p><p>Beyond the hardware, poor business decisions helped further seal the 5200's fate. First, Atari failed to motivate third-party development for the console. Second, Atari management decided to devote most of their resources to the already oversaturated 2600 market while leaving the 5200 idle. Atari had numerous replacement consoles for the 5200 in the works before they decided to invest research and development into the <a href=\"\/atari-7800\/3045-70\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-70\">Atari 7800<\/a>. Atari Inc. originally planned on developing a smaller, cost-reduced version of the Atari 5200, which would have gotten rid of the controller storage bin. This prototype was called the Atari 5100 and would have been a more simple and user friendly 5200, but the project was eventually canceled. Before settling on the 7800 Atari's originally planned sequel to the 5200 was a system called the 3200, but its development halted because it was too difficult to develop for.<br \/><br \/><\/p><h2>Technical Specifications<\/h2><ul><li><strong>CPU:<\/strong> Custom MOS 6502C @ 1.79 MHz<\/li><li><strong>RAM:<\/strong> 16 KB<\/li><li><strong>ROM:<\/strong> 2KB on-board BIOS; 32 KB window for standard game cartridges.<\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> ANTIC and GTIA chips similar to those in Atari's 400\/800 home computers<\/li><li><strong>Sound:<\/strong> 4-channel POKEY chip<\/li><li><strong>Screen Resolution:<\/strong> 320x192 resolution<\/li><li><strong>Size:<\/strong> 13\" x 15\" x 4.35\"<\/li><\/ul>",

In the eyes of <a href=\"\/atari\/3010-182\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-182\" data-mce-href=\"\/atari\/3010-182\/\">Atari<\/a> management the Atari 7800 would be a return to form after the lackluster performance of the <a href=\"\/atari-5200\/3045-67\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-67\" data-mce-href=\"\/atari-5200\/3045-67\/\">Atari 5200<\/a>, as the Atari 7800 would address almost all of the shortcomings of the Atari 5200. However due to series of unfortunate events and ill-conceived business decisions the system wouldn\u2019t launch until almost two years after its announcement. By this time <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" data-mce-href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\">Nintendo<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\" data-mce-href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\">Sega<\/a> were dominating a newly rejuvenated home console market in the United States, but Atari still saw the opportunity to re-introduce the Atari name into American homes. Yet the Atari 7800 would mark a turning point for Atari as a console manufacturer as the console\u2019s struggle to regain public popularity marked the eventual collapse of the Atari brand name and company as a whole.<\/p><h2>Backstory<\/h2><p>In July of 1984, the home video game division of Atari was purchased by the now infamous Jack Tramiel. Although the Atari 7800 was ready to go at this point, licensing negotiations had to begin again because the Tramiels did not agree with existing licensing arrangements, as a result the release of the 7800 was delayed. It was around this time that the video game market crashed, and retailers cut orders and shipments for video games across the board. As a result, by the end of 1984 the industry was left with only Atari, <a href=\"\/coleco\/3010-302\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-302\" data-mce-href=\"\/coleco\/3010-302\/\">Coleco<\/a> ( <a href=\"\/colecovision\/3045-47\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-47\" data-mce-href=\"\/colecovision\/3045-47\/\">ColecoVision<\/a>), and <a href=\"\/mattel-electronics\/3010-460\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-460\" data-mce-href=\"\/mattel-electronics\/3010-460\/\">Mattel<\/a> ( <a href=\"\/intellivision\/3045-51\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-51\" data-mce-href=\"\/intellivision\/3045-51\/\">Intellivision<\/a>) all of which decided to turn out new product for their old systems instead of developing new consoles, as such no new consoles were on the horizon for the United States. However Atari after spending the last two years working out the paperwork for the 7800s, by 1986 the 7800 was ready for release.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082812-scaleim.php.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082812\" data-size=\"large\" data-ratio=\"1.385\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082812-scaleim.php.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082812\"><img alt=\"One of the few third party games for the 7800\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082812-scaleim.php.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082812-scaleim.php.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"><\/a><figcaption>One of the few third party games for the 7800<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>However, on October 15, 1985, everything changed.<\/p><p>Unbeknownst to Atari, a Japanese company called <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" data-mce-href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\">Nintendo<\/a> decided to bring their successful <a href=\"\/nes\/3045-21\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" data-mce-href=\"\/nes\/3045-21\/\">Famicom<\/a> console over to the United States. In their ignorance Atari management ignored the Famicom, and even skipped the chance to publish the American version of the Famicom. This mistake alone would prove to be one of the most costly mistakes ever enacted by Atari and even the video game industry.<\/p><p>Despite the fact that the American home console market was reeling from the video game crash of 1983, Nintendo still saw potential consumers. They were right; by 1986 the Nintendo Entertainment System had become an enormous hit with American consumers. With this in mind Tramiel and Atari continued with the release of the 7800, in hopes of reaping in the rewards of a newly awaken home console market.<\/p><p>At launch the 7800 had twelve titles ready to play. Also the system was completely compatible with <a href=\"\/atari-2600\/3045-40\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-40\" data-mce-href=\"\/atari-2600\/3045-40\/\">2600<\/a> games, a feature that the previous <a href=\"\/atari-5200\/3045-67\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-67\" data-mce-href=\"\/atari-5200\/3045-67\/\">5200<\/a> console lacked. The public was excited, and the 7800 was poised to take over the gaming world, but unfortunately it didn't quite happen that way.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082810-7800_ballblazer_intro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082810\" data-size=\"large\" data-ratio=\"1.2090909090909\" data-width=\"220\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 220px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082810-7800_ballblazer_intro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082810\"><img alt=\"Not exactly what we would call a \"killer-app\"\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" data-width=\"220\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082810-7800_ballblazer_intro.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082810-7800_ballblazer_intro.jpg 220w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Not exactly what we would call a \"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Not exactly what we would call a \"killer-app\"<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Instead Tramiel and the rest of Atari management would make various business mistakes with the release of the system. The first of which was the fact that Atari had failed to promote and captivate developers to adopt the system and develop games for the 7800. Instead Atari would concentrate on advertising the complete backwards compatibility the 7800 had with the 2600 games instead of the 7800's own library of games. In fact only 10 games were developed and released by third party developers for the 7800 during its lifetime, 6 from <a href=\"\/absolute-entertainment\/3010-666\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-666\" data-mce-href=\"\/absolute-entertainment\/3010-666\/\">Absolute Entertainment<\/a>; 2 from <a href=\"\/activision\/3010-78\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" data-mce-href=\"\/activision\/3010-78\/\">Activision<\/a>; and 2 from <a href=\"\/froggo-games-corporation\/3010-3982\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3982\" data-mce-href=\"\/froggo-games-corporation\/3010-3982\/\">Froggo<\/a>. This meant that the 7800 would have to rely on in-house development from Atari in order to supply games for the system. However was not enough to compete with the NES\u2019s or even the <a href=\"\/sega-master-system\/3045-8\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-8\" data-mce-href=\"\/sega-master-system\/3045-8\/\">Sega Master System<\/a>\u2019s rapidly expanding video game libraries. Also the launch for the system itself was poorly planned. Of the promised tweleves launch titles only three were actually available at the time of the system's launch. Not only that but the 7800 was poorly distributed amongst retailers making the system hard to find during its launch. As a result the 7800 was never able to recover from its rocky launch and in the end due to poorly conceived business decisions and a highly competitive console market failed to reach the market capitalization that Atari had hoped the system would obtain.<\/p><h3>US Cumulative Sales<\/h3><p>1986: <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/atariage.com\/forums\/topic\/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\" data-mce-href=\"http:\/\/atariage.com\/forums\/topic\/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached\/\">286,417<\/a><\/strong><\/p><p>1987: <strong>1,599,978<\/strong> (<a href=\"http:\/\/atariage.com\/forums\/topic\/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\" data-mce-href=\"http:\/\/atariage.com\/forums\/topic\/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached\/\">+1,313,561<\/a>)<\/p><p>1988: <strong>3,023,955<\/strong> (<a href=\"http:\/\/atariage.com\/forums\/topic\/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\" data-mce-href=\"http:\/\/atariage.com\/forums\/topic\/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached\/\">+1,423,977<\/a>)<\/p><p>1989: <strong>3,679,308<\/strong> (<a href=\"http:\/\/atariage.com\/forums\/topic\/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\" data-mce-href=\"http:\/\/atariage.com\/forums\/topic\/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached\/\">+655,353<\/a>)<\/p><p>1990: <strong>3,772,751<\/strong> (<a href=\"http:\/\/atariage.com\/forums\/topic\/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\" data-mce-href=\"http:\/\/atariage.com\/forums\/topic\/144552-happy-25th-7800-sales-figures-attached\/\">+93,443<\/a>)<\/p><h2>Design<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082807-7800_controller_intro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082807\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.88181818181818\" data-width=\"220\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 220px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082807-7800_controller_intro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082807\"><img alt=\"Atari Pro-Line Controller\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" data-width=\"220\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082807-7800_controller_intro.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082807-7800_controller_intro.jpg 220w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Atari Pro-Line Controller\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082807-7800_controller_intro.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082807-7800_controller_intro.jpg 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" data-width=\"220\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Atari Pro-Line Controller<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>At the time of its release, the 7800 was initially billed as a graphical powerhouse. The new custom CPU and MARIA graphics chip that would power the system were capable of moving up to 100 objects on-screen (drawn with a line-buffer) at the same time and capable of displaying up to 25 colors on screen out of a 256 color palette. However, the system suffered from poor audio quality due to the fact that the system utilized the same sound chip from the 2600.<\/p><p>The system is indeed compatible with almost 100% of the existing <a href=\"\/atari-2600\/3045-40\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-40\" data-mce-href=\"\/atari-2600\/3045-40\/\">Atari 2600<\/a> game library, and all the existing 2600 controllers and peripherals are compatible as well. The 7800 was also sold with its own special Proline controllers which were meant to be an improvement over the <a href=\"\/atari-5200\/3045-67\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-67\" data-mce-href=\"\/atari-5200\/3045-67\/\">5200<\/a> design. The controller was a two-button controller, allowing for greater functionality than the classic one-button from the 2600 days.<\/p><p>Along with inferior sound quality, the 7800 was also technically lacking compared to the NES in several other ways. The 7800's CPU and MARIA graphics chip both shared the same RAM memory address space, interrupting each other's cycles when attempting to access RAM and slowing down the system, whereas the NES had separate RAM memory address spaces for its CPU and PPU graphics chip, allowing both to run at full speeds. The 7800's coarse scrolling, with occasional 8-pixel jumps, was not as smooth as the NES's continuous pixel-by-pixel scrolling. The 7800 also lacked a tilemap engine like the NES, meaning the 7800 had to use more memory and processing to produce the same amount of graphics as the NES, and also had to draw tiled backgrounds using numerous sprites, slowing down the system and making it difficult for third-party developers to produce tiled <a href=\"\/side-scrolling\/3015-299\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-299\" data-mce-href=\"\/side-scrolling\/3015-299\/\">side-scrolling<\/a> games for the system. While the 7800 had a 320x200 resolution mode, it was resource-intensive, so most 7800 games usually ran at the lower-resolution 160x200 mode (compared to the NES's 256x224 resolution).<\/p><h2>Legacy<\/h2><p>Sales from the console were middling outside of the United Sates. With numerous third party developers quickly dropping support for the 7800 and gamers everywhere ignoring the console as a whole Atari pulled the plug on the 7800 by 1992 and ceased all production of the console. In the end Atari was no longer the console manufacturer that it once was, but unconvinced by their failure Atari would make one <a href=\"\/jaguar\/3045-28\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-28\" data-mce-href=\"\/jaguar\/3045-28\/\">last ditch effort<\/a> to regain their once dominant status in the video game console market.<\/p><h2>Technical Specifications<\/h2><p>* CPU: Custom 6502C<\/p><p>Speed: 1.79 MHz, drops to 1.19 MHz when the TIA or RIOT chips are accessed<\/p><p>(note: This is Atari's custom 6502 known as SALLY which can be halted to allow other devices to control the bus)<\/p><p>* RAM: 4 KB (2 6116 2Kx8 RAM ICs)<\/p><p>* ROM: built in 4 KB BIOS ROM, 48 KB Cartridge ROM space without bankswitching<\/p><p>* Graphics: MARIA custom graphics controller (halts CPU when in use)<\/p><p>160x200 (160x240 PAL) resolution or 320x200 (320x240) resolution<\/p><p>25 color palette out of 256 colors (16 hues * 16 luma), different graphics modes restricted the number of usable colors and the number of colors per sprite<\/p><p>Direct Memory Access (DMA)<\/p><p>Graphics clock: 7.16 MHz (halted when CPU in use)<\/p><p>* I\/O: Joystick and console switch IO handled byte 6532 RIOT and TIA<\/p><p>* Ports: 2 joystick ports, 1 cartridge port, 1 expansion connector, power in, RF output<\/p><p>* Sound: TIA video and sound chip, same as the 2600.

The line was later expanded to include the more-powerful Atari XL models and then the XE models. Atari's second cartridge-based console, the <a href=\"\/atari-5200\/3045-67\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-67\">Atari 5200<\/a>, is also based on the same hardware, resulting in many games appearing to be identical across all platforms.

The computers also includes custom chips like the ANTIC display instruction processor, the CTIA\/GTIA GPU and the POKEY audio chip. The Atari 400 and 800 were supposed to have 4kB and 8kB RAM respectively, and the names 400 and 800 were originally decided upon because of this, but both models were released with 8kB of RAM since the price of memory had fallen when they were released. The 400 has a membrane keyboard while the 800 has a regular one. The 800 also has two ROM cartridge slots instead of the single slot in the 400. Despite this, the 400 outsold the 800 somewhat.<\/p><figure style=\"width: 1250px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1303271\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6552\" data-width=\"1250\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1303271\"><img alt=\"Atari 130XE.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9560\/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg 1250w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/9560\/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9560\/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9560\/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Atari 130XE.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9560\/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg 1250w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/9560\/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9560\/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9560\/1303271-atari_130xe.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Atari 130XE.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In 1982 the 1200XL was released which came with 64kB RAM, a redesigned aluminum case and more custom keys. Some older software was incompatible with the new OS however. A year later the 600XL and 800XL were released which replaced the other models, including the 1200XL. The 600XL had 16kB of RAM and the 800XL had 64kB like the 1200XL did, and used the same general design. A new hardware feature on both these models was the expansion port called the Parallel Bus Interface.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After Atari was acquired by Jack Tremiel in 1985, the 8-bit Atari computers once again got a new hardware revision known as the XE series along with the 16-bit <a href=\"\/atari-st\/3045-13\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-13\">Atari ST<\/a> computer. XE stands for XL-Enhanced. They have a similar case design to the Atari ST line of computers but are otherwise identical on the hardware level to the old 8-bit computers, except for the newer Enhanced Cartridge Interface instead of the Paralell Bus Interface and the fact that the 130XE had 128kB of RAM.<\/p><figure style=\"width: 443px\" data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/1303270-atari_xe_console.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1303270\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.83747178329571\" data-width=\"443\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/1303270-atari_xe_console.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1303270\"><img alt=\"XE Game System.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9560\/1303270-atari_xe_console.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/1303270-atari_xe_console.jpg 443w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9560\/1303270-atari_xe_console.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"XE Game System.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9560\/1303270-atari_xe_console.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/1303270-atari_xe_console.jpg 443w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9560\/1303270-atari_xe_console.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>XE Game System.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In 1987, after seeing the success of the <a href=\"\/nes\/3045-21\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES<\/a>, Atari wanted back in on the console market. They<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">used hardware from a 65XE to create what we know today as the Atari XE Game System. It included a detachable keyboard, a joystick, a <a href=\"\/light-gun\/3015-2354\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2354\">lightgun<\/a> and the games Bug Hunt and <a href=\"\/flight-simulator-ii\/3030-14112\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14112\">Flight Simulator II<\/a>. Instead of cassette tapes or diskettes, the XE Game System uses cartridges like most other home consoles at the time. Because the XE Game System was almost the same hardware-wise as the 65XE, a lot of software and hardware for the Atari 8-bit computers are compatible. The system didn't sell as well as hoped, partly because of bad marketing and the fact that new releases for the system were few and far between.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In 1992, Atari officially dropped support for their entire 8-bit line of machines.<\/p><h3>Models<\/h3><figure style=\"width: 2272px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1303277\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"2272\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1303277\"><img alt=\"Atari 400's membrane keyboard.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9560\/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg 2272w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/9560\/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9560\/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9560\/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Atari 400's membrane keyboard.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9560\/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg 2272w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/9560\/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9560\/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9560\/1303277-atari_400_keyboard.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Atari 400's membrane keyboard.<\/figcaption><\/figure><ul><li>400 and 800 (1979) \u2013 original machines in beige cases, 400 has a membrane keyboard, 800 has \"full-travel\" keys, two cartridge ports, monitor output, expandable memory slots (up to 48 KB).

This never came to fruition as it was not deemed cost-effective.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Lynx was highly advanced for the time, and was the first handheld console with a fully backlit screen and 16-bit technology. Further, a Lynx is ambidextrous with a simple flip. In 1991, Atari released the updated Lynx II. Slightly smaller than the original and with improved aesthetics, it is still quite large and bulky compared to other contemporary consoles. Over 100 games were released for the system over its life span, and it had an estimated 500,000 user install base worldwide.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Criticisms of the console are generally regarding the relatively large size, short battery life, and lack of third-party support. The <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo<\/a> <a href=\"\/game-boy\/3045-3\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega<\/a> <a href=\"\/game-gear\/3045-5\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-5\">Game Gear<\/a> both dominated the market into the early nineties, though the Lynx continued to do well, particularly in Europe. By 1996, Atari ceased production of the system.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Today the Atari Lynx still has a dedicated cult following, with some developers and private individuals still making and producing games for the platform. In 2008 the system, and Atari were honored by the 59th annual technology and engineering Emmy awards, for pioneering the handheld gaming platform.<\/p><h2>Hardware<\/h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">CPU - Dual 16-bit CMOS, Mikey &amp; Suzy (16MHZ)<\/p><figure style=\"width: 800px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3104\/417046-atari_lynx_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-417046\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3104\/417046-atari_lynx_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-417046\"><img alt=\"Atari Lynx console\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3104\/417046-atari_lynx_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3104\/417046-atari_lynx_1.jpg 800w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3104\/417046-atari_lynx_1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/a><figcaption>Atari Lynx console<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">RAM - 64KB DRAM.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">On Screen Colors - 4096 (16 simultaneous per scan line).<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Screen Resolution - 160x102 Pixels.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Screen - LCD 82.55mm x 47.75mm and (88.9mm\/3.5\" diagonal).<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Sound - 8-bit 4 channel (mono for Lynx I and Stereo sound for Lynx II).<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Game Cartridge - 2MB (16Mbit).<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Power Supply - AC adapter or batteries.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Battery Life - 4 hours for the Lynx I and 5 hours for Lynx II (6 AA batteries Alkaline).<\/p><h3>Launch titles in North America<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"\/blue-lightning\/3030-3142\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3142\">Blue Lightning<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/california-games\/3030-3193\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3193\">California Games<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/electrocop\/3030-11150\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11150\">Electrocop<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/gates-of-zendocon\/3030-6909\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6909\">Gates of Zendocon<\/a><\/li><\/ul>",

It included an 8mhz Motorola 68000 CPU and 512kb RAM. Later models, called STFM, had a built-in floppy disk drive, RF-modulator and had the power supply built into the case. \"ST\" means Sixteen-Thirtytwo, because of the CPU's 16bit data bus and 32bit internals.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It became popular in businesses because of the excellent office applications, in the homes of people because of the great games and amongst musicians because of its built-in MIDI ports and software like Cubase. The Atari ST was in direct competition with Commodore's <a href=\"\/amiga\/3045-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Amiga<\/a> and Apple's <a href=\"\/mac\/3045-17\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Macintosh<\/a> line of computers, and to some extent the <a href=\"\/amstrad-cpc\/3045-11\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-11\">Amstrad CPC<\/a> line of computers. The developement was lead by <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/jack-tramiel\/3040-98032\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-98032\">Jack Tramiel<\/a>, who had recently left <a href=\"\/commodore\/3010-2000\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2000\">Commodore <\/a>(Tramiel actually started the Commodore company and developed among other computers the <a href=\"\/commodore-64\/3045-14\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">C64<\/a>.) to buy the rights to the Atari name. The Atari ST was intended to be an affordable computer with fast performance. But because it was supposed to be affordable, it is not as powerful in the audio and graphics department as the Commodore Amiga. Focus was instead put on including a fast CPU and lots of RAM.<\/p><h2>Hardware<\/h2><h3>Specifications<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">These are the basic specifications for the Atari 520ST:<\/p><ul><li><b>CPU:<\/b> Motorola 68000 16\/32bit @ 8mhz. 16 bit data bus\/32 bit internal\/24-bit address bus.<\/li><li><b>RAM:<\/b> 512kb (1mb for the 1040ST models)<\/li><li><b>Soundchip:<\/b> Yamaha YM2149F 3-voice squarewave plus 1-voice white noise mono PSG(plus 2 channels on the STE models).<\/li><li><b>Diskdrive:<\/b> Single-sided 3\u00bd\" floppy disk drive. 360kb capacity(1040ST had double-sided drives which had a capacity of 720kb).<\/li><li><b>Display:<\/b> 60 Hz NTSC, 50 Hz PAL, 71.2 Hz monochrome:<\/li><\/ul><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Low Resolution - 320\u00d7200 (16 color), palette of 512 colors<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Medium resolution - 640\u00d7200 (4 color), palette of 512 colors<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">High resolution - 640\u00d7400 (mono), monochrome<\/p><ul><li><b>Ports:<\/b> TV out (on ST-M and ST-FM models, NTSC or PAL standard RF modulated), MIDI in\/out (with 'out-thru'), RS-232 serial, Centronics parallel (printer), monitor (RGB or Composite Video colour and mono, 13-pin DIN), extra disk drive port (15-pin DIN), DMA port (ACSI port, Atari Computer System Interface) for hard disks and Atari Laser Printer (sharing RAM with computer system), joystick and mouse ports (9-pin MSX standard).<\/li><li><b>Operating System:<\/b> TOS (<b>T<\/b>he <b>O<\/b>perating <b>S<\/b>ystem) with the GEM user interface.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Models<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are a couple of different models of the Atari ST. They are:<\/p><ul><li><b>Atari 130ST<\/b> - Never released. Was supposed to come with only 128kb ram. But the operating system alone took up almost all that amount, so they canceled it.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Atari 260ST<\/b> - Only released in Europe. It was first only a prototype just like the 130ST but was eventually released in Europe. It is identical to the 520ST and was released to differentiate it from the new 520ST+.<\/li><li><b>Atari 520ST<\/b> - The original model described in Specifications.<\/li><li><b>Atari 520STM<\/b> - Model with only RF modulation built in, without floppy drive. Not very common.<\/li><li><b>Atari 520STFM<\/b> - Built-in floppy drive, RF modulator and power supply.<\/li><li><b>Atari 520ST<\/b><strong>+<\/strong><b> <\/b> - 1mb RAM but no floppy drive.<\/li><li><b>Atari 1040STF<\/b> - A 520ST with built in double sided DD disk drive and 1mb ram.

Comes with 2 or 4mb of RAM. Includes a real-time clock and an internal connector for expansion. Most models also includes the BLiTTER graphics chip.<\/li><li><b>520STE and 1040STE<\/b> - Same as 520STFM\/1040STFM but includes the BLiTTER graphics chip and has enhanced sound and color palettes. The sound chip has 2 extra channels that can be used for sampled sounds. The color palette is extended to 4096 colors. Unfortunately the STE specific features were rarely used in commercial software.<\/li><li><b>Mega STE<\/b> - Same hardware as the 1040STE has, but with a 16mhz CPU.<\/li><li><b>STacy<\/b> - A portable version of the ST.<\/li><li><b>ST BOOK <\/b>- Portable version of the STE. It was more portable than the STacy but sacrifice many features in order to achieve that.<\/li><\/ul><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Prototypes\/Vaporware (Never Officially Released)<\/p><ul><li>1040 STE+ (STE 2080) \u2013 Similar to the 1040STE but with a additional, intern AMD 80286 CPU and a 40MB HD (2,5\")<\/li><\/ul><h2>Operating System<\/h2><h3>Details<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The operating system in the Atari ST is called TOS which means simply \"The Operating System\". It combines the GEM GUI and the underlying GEMDOS, a DOS like operating system, both by Digital Research. TOS is stored in onboard ROM chips, though early versions of the Atari ST came with TOS on floppy disks. Because it is stored on ROM chips it boots up instantly. Some people jokingly says that TOS means \"Tremiel Operating System\", since Jack Tremiel was the one leading the developement of the Atari ST.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">TOS is composed of the following parts:<\/p><ul><li><b>GEMDOS<\/b> - GEM Disk Operating System (A DOS-like operating system Digital Research had experimented with a little bit before Atari decided to use GEM.)<\/li><li><b>GEM<\/b> - Graphical Environment Manager (A graphical environment. GEM itself consists of AES, VDI and GEM Desktop.)<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>AES<\/b> - Application Environment Service (Provides the window system, window manager and other GUI elements.)<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>VDI<\/b> - Virtual Device Interface (The core graphics system of the GEM engine.)<\/li><li><b>GEM<\/b> Desktop (An application using AES to provide a file manager and application launcher.)<\/li><li><b>BIOS<\/b> - Basic Input\/Output System<\/li><li><b>XBIOS<\/b> - Extended BIOS<\/li><li><b>Line-A<\/b> (Low-level high-speed graphics calls.)<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>GDOS<\/b> - Graphics Device Operation System (Sends commands from VDI to the proper device driver for rendering graphics.)<\/li><li><b>AHDI<\/b> - Atari Hard Disk Interface (Driver for Hard Drive. Has to be loaded seperately.)<\/li><\/ul><h3>Desktop<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/779987-220078_16_atarigem.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-779987\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/779987-220078_16_atarigem.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-779987\"><img alt=\"The GEM desktop in low resolution (320x200)\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9560\/779987-220078_16_atarigem.gif\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/779987-220078_16_atarigem.gif 640w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9560\/779987-220078_16_atarigem.gif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/a><figcaption>The GEM desktop in low resolution (320x200)<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The desktop looks like most other desktops in that it uses icons to represent devices and files, and has windows and dialog boxes. The standard desktop has a trashcan and two floppy disk icons, even if you only have one floppy drive. On the top part is a context sensitive panel. It changes it's contents depending on the application (much like on a Macintosh), though applications are not required to even use the panel in which case it is removed.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">TOS can execute a variety of different filetypes. They can be identified by their extensions:<\/p><ul><li><b>*.ACC<\/b> - Desktop accessory. Loaded automatically when the application loads.<\/li><li><b>*.APP<\/b> - Application. Was not used very often.<\/li><li><b>*.PRG<\/b> - Executable program. Often GEM programs.<\/li><li><b>*.TOS<\/b> - Programs that only uses GEMDOS and not the GEM system to function. (i.e. it doesn't use GEM to draw windows.)<\/li><li><b>*.TTP<\/b> - TOS Takes Parameters. Opens up a dialog box in which you can add arguments for the program.<\/li><\/ul><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It is possible to autoboot TOS programs (but not GEM programs) on startup by placing the program inside a folder named \"AUTO\" on a floppy disk. If the floppy is inserted into the drive when the computer boots, it will bypass the GEM desktop and boot the TOS program instead. This is used by many demos and most games.<\/p><h3>Similarity to Macintosh UI<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The look and feel of GEM for Atari ST is very much like the one in the original Macintosh. Apple sued Digital Research over this and Digital Reasearch had to redesign their GEM window manager for other architectures. But since it was mostly Atari who developed the Motorola 68000 version, they were given the rights to further develop the 68k version without Digital Research's consent. Because of this, Atari was not affected by the Apple-Digital Research lawsuit and were allowed to have a more Mac-like look and feel.<\/p><h2>Demo scene<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/699568-virtual_escape.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-699568\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/699568-virtual_escape.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-699568\"><img alt=\"\"Virtual Escape\" demo by Equinox\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/699568-virtual_escape.gif\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/699568-virtual_escape.gif 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>\"Virtual Escape\" demo by Equinox<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As with most other early computers, there is a scene of people still active on the Atari ST platform. They use the ST to create productions called \"demos\", which is a program demonstrating the demo group's programming, graphics making and music composing abilities on limited hardware.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The groups came up with new programming techniques to push the limits of the computer to do things that people would've only dreamed about doing years ago. Some of these techniques were later used in games for the Atari ST. For example the technique to display graphics in the borders of the screen.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/699564-left_border.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-699564\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5825\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/699564-left_border.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-699564\"><img alt=\"\"Death of the left border\" screen by TNT Crew.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/699564-left_border.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9560\/699564-left_border.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>\"Death of the left border\" screen by TNT Crew.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Since the Atari ST was not powerful enough to display graphics in fullscreen, Atari put borders on the sides of the screen. But after many years of experimenting, people in the demo scene removed those borders one by one, starting with the upper border. The last border to be removed was the left one that was thought to be impossible to remove. But once again a demo group succeeded with removing the border and were finally able to display graphics in fullscreen. Of course, this had an impact on performance, so you couldn't do everything you could do otherwise.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The people in the demo scene on the Atari ST were also very involved in the game side of things. Some demo groups even started their own game companies and made some of the best games for the ST with the techniques they had invented, like the mentioned ability to put graphics where the borders should have been.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">One example of this is in the game <a href=\"\/lethal-xcess-wings-of-death-ii\/3030-11117\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11117\">Lethal Xcess<\/a>. <a href=\"\/thalion-software\/3010-1964\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1964\">Thalion Software<\/a> who made the game, put the HUD in the upper border of the screen so that the playing field wouldn't be smaller. Thalion Software was comprised of people from various demo groups and made some of the best games for the Atari ST, like <a href=\"\/amberstar\/3030-10464\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10464\">Amberstar<\/a> and <a href=\"\/enchanted-land\/3030-23957\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23957\">Enchanted Land<\/a>.

Each system contains a bin built into the system capable of holding 15 cartridges, and a removable dustcover that protects the games inside. The front of the console also contains a 24-button keypad, an Eject button, and a Start button. The back of the console has non-removable AC Adapter and video out plugs, as well as four removable controller ports.<\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Game Support<\/h2><p> <\/p><p>The games are cartridge based, with each cartridge equivalent to the size of a standard audio cassette tape.

Pressing the Eject button releases the cartridge. There were approximately thirty game cartirdges released into public domain.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>The system itself contains four built-in games: <a href=\"\/gunfight\/3030-30657\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30657\"> Gunfight<\/a> (a 2-player versus game) Checkmate (a Tron-like game in which one player cannot cross the path of another player) Scribbling (a very basic drawing program), and <a href=\"\/calculator\/3055-2985\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2985\"> Calculator<\/a> (self-explanatory).<\/p><h2>Controller<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2824\/1330072-astrocade_joystick.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1330072\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.96204033214709\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:96.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2824\/1330072-astrocade_joystick.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1330072\"><img alt=\"Astrocade, controller\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/2824\/1330072-astrocade_joystick.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2824\/1330072-astrocade_joystick.png 843w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/2824\/1330072-astrocade_joystick.png 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/2824\/1330072-astrocade_joystick.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Astrocade, controller<\/figcaption><\/figure><p> <\/p><p>The Astrocade has a very unqiue analog controller. The stick itself is capable of free motion in any direction. The top of the stick twists like a dial, for use with Pong-style gameplay in which a paddle moves along a singular axis.

Two revisions were released in November, 1981 the entry-level Model A at \u00a3235 and standard Model B at \u00a3335. Model B's included additional RAM a second processor.

            "description": "<p>The <a href=\"\/philips-interactive-media-inc\/3010-48\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-48\"> Philips<\/a> CD-i, released on November 2, 1991, not only boasted games in its library, but also some encyclopedia and <a href=\"\/edutainment\/3015-2173\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2173\"> \"Edutainment\"<\/a> products, as well as feature-length movies (which required an additional video card), providing digital home video releases before DVD entered the market. This device is probably best remembered for the late-night commercials that ran in the early 1990s showing off its awesome power as a hapless man searched for the \"meaning of life\". The system eventually gives him his answer, after forcing him to play tennis and other video games. The system used <a href=\"\/compact-disc\/3055-2133\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2133\">compact discs<\/a> for its software releases, and also featured <a href=\"\/full-motion-video\/3015-604\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-604\"> full motion video<\/a> content. Philips' attempt to enter the gaming market would be trumped by <a href=\"\/sony-computer-entertainment-america\/3010-313\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-313\"> Sony<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\"> PlayStation<\/a>, which unlike the CD-i, featured 3D-graphics rendering technology and significantly more support from first- and third-party developers.<\/p><p>The system also suffered from a bit of an identity crisis. Upon release, Philips did not wish to compete with the likes of <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\"> Sega<\/a> and <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\"> Nintendo<\/a> in the home console market; instead, Philips positioned the console as a \"multimedia system\" that could play videos, run applications, and could act as an educational tool. This led to a swath of educational game releases, which has never been a bestselling niche in the entertainment software market. Philips tried to position the system as a console that could compete with the likes of the <a href=\"\/sega-cd\/3045-29\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-29\"> Sega CD<\/a> and <a href=\"\/3do\/3045-26\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-26\"> 3DO<\/a>, but by then most consumers did not view the console as a serious contender to incumbents, not to mention its high starting price and underwhelming library of games.<\/p><p>The CD-i also has the notable (and dubious) distinction of being the only non-<a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo<\/a> console to have <a href=\"\/mario\/3025-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1\"> Mario<\/a> and <a href=\"\/the-legend-of-zelda\/3025-9\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-9\"> Zelda<\/a> titles developed for it, due to a contractual obligation Nintendo had with Philips dating back to the <a href=\"\/snes\/3045-9\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\"> SNES<\/a> CD project.

At this point, Fairchild entered the market with a new machine that attempted to differentiate itself by doing numerous new and exciting things.<\/p><p>The Fairchild VES was designed by <a href=\"\/gerald-jerry-lawson\/3040-100049\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-100049\">Gerald Jerry Lawson<\/a> and developed by <a href=\"\/fairchild-camera-and-instrument-corp\/3010-810\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-810\">Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation<\/a> through its well known subsidiary <a href=\"\/fairchild-semiconductor\/3010-2362\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2362\">Fairchild Semiconductor<\/a>, a well known semiconductor company that continues to exist to this day. With the home video game market growing in leaps and bounds with the introduction of Pong, Fairchild was one of many electronic companies that wanted a piece of the market. Using one of their in house microprocessors, Fairchild Semiconductor set out to differentiate their console from the competition from the inside out, and in many ways they succeeded.<\/p><h2>Revolutionary Design<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082936-channelfcontroller.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082936\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.4516129032258\" data-width=\"62\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 62px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:245.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082936-channelfcontroller.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082936\"><img alt=\"Channel F controller\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082936-channelfcontroller.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082936-channelfcontroller.jpg 62w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 62px) 100vw, 62px\" data-width=\"62\"><\/a><figcaption>Channel F controller<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The VES's overall look and design of the console was a fusion of new and established ideas. The console only resembled its competition from a superficial perspective. Any person who examined the console from the inside would see that that was not the case.<\/p><p>Firstly, the console featured detachable controllers which was a new concept when the console was first introduced. The controller had a grip on it to allow players to more easily play their games and it had only a few buttons to allow for games to be easily accessible. The controllers were connected to the console through dedicated 8-foot wires preventing users from losing their controllers.<\/p><p>However, the most important aspect of the Channel F's design lay in the way users started\/booted up their game. Fairchild's new console featured plug-in cartridges that contained ROM chips. This cartridge based system was vastly different from the plug-in games for <a href=\"\/magnavox\/3010-1164\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1164\">Magnavox<\/a>\u2019s <a href=\"\/odyssey\/3045-74\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-74\">Odyssey<\/a> or <a href=\"\/atari\/3010-634\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-634\">Atari<\/a>\u2019s Pong game system. This allowed Fairchild to be able to market their console as the home console with the most choices and longest shelf life. At the time of the consoles release the design differences worked and the console began outselling much of its competition. When first introduced, the Fairchild VES also retailed for $169.95; cartridges sold for $19.95 each.<\/p><h2>Atari Takes Notice<\/h2><p>With all of this <a href=\"\/atari\/3010-634\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-634\">Atari<\/a> had finally decided to release their own cartridge based home console called the \u201cAtari Video Computer System,\u201d (Atari retitled the console to the more well known name of <a href=\"\/atari-2600\/3045-40\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-40\">Atari 2600<\/a>). Despite changing the name of the console from the Fairchild VES to Fairchild Channel F to differentiate the console from Atari\u2019s, the added competition had done its damage. With the release of the <a href=\"\/atari-vcs-joystick\/3055-785\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-785\">Atari VCS<\/a>, the Channel F was beginning to look outdated when compared to Atari\u2019s console. Fairchild attempt to counteract this by introducing newer models of the console however this was met with mixed success.<\/p><p>However by starting this \u201cconsole war\u201d, Atari and Fairchild Semiconductors' war would have dire consequences for both of the companies. The release of Fairchild's system the year before and, and the subsequent release of Atari's system had set into motion what would become known as the \"First Video game Crash.\" By making dedicated consoles all but obsolete, dedicated consoles were being sold well below their market value which in turn de-valued the video game market. With an overabundance of cheap video game consoles to choose from and the new hand held electronic gaming market (e.g. Simon, Mattel Football, ect.) emerging, Fairchild would go back to the semiconductor business and discontinued the Channel F by 1978 due to declining profits.<\/p><h2>A Second Chance to Succeed<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082927-system2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082927\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.648\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082927-system2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082927\"><img alt=\"A Channel F-System II\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082927-system2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082927-system2.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Channel F-System II\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082927-system2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1082927-system2.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A Channel F-System II<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Having lasted only a year and 4 months, from 1976-1977, one would have thought the Channel F's story would end there. However, by 1979, a company by the name of Zircon made a curious move; they bought all the rights to the Channel F and games released for the console. Later they re-released Fairchild F, but this time in the shape of a scaled-down model that was priced at $99. This system was dubbed the Channel F System II, and it lasted from 1981-1984. In fact some gamers who claim to have owned a Fairchild Channel F often don't realize that there were two different versions. Zircon would not only license their version of the Fairchild F in the United States, but would instead licensed the console all throughout Europe and Great Britain. In Germany it was dubbed the Saba Video Play, the <a href=\"\/luxor\/3010-813\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-813\">Luxor<\/a> Video Entertainment System in Sweden, and the Grandstand in Great Britain. This re-model shared some notable differences from its original counterpart but was ultimately the same console, especially seeing how it was backwards compatible with the System I games, but updated with more advanced technology. The System II model played sounds via the user\u2019s TV set, rather than generating sound through an internal speaker built in the console. The Channel F System II also had removable controllers. This version of the Fairchild F saw various levels of success, but ultimately was discontinued as a result of the \u201cSecond Video Game Crash.\u201d<\/p><h2>Legacy<\/h2><p>By 1978, Fairchild had released 23 games for the Channel F, with Zircon chipping in four new titles a couple years later. The games vary from single to multi-game cartridges, and the various options for the games are selected by the 4 main buttons on the front of the console. While its library pales in comparison to that of the 2600, it was large and comprehensive to that of the dedicated console market it had intended to attack.<\/p><p>It was the first microprocessor-based home system ever released, and microprocessors have remained the standard for all consoles and home computers released since. Being the first cartridge based console, the Fairchild Channel F would also establish cartridges as the go to format for console manufactures until the advent of the CD-ROM. An equally important thing to note about the release of the Fairchild is the effect it had on Atari. By posing a threat to Atari, the Fairchild Channel F would motivate <a href=\"\/atari\/3010-634\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-634\">Atari<\/a> to innovate and develop one of the most important video game consoles the video game industry would ever witness up until that time, the <a href=\"\/atari-2600\/3045-40\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-40\">Atari 2600<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Technical Specifications<\/h2><ul><li>CPU chip: Fairchild F8 operating at 1.79 MHz (PAL 2.22 MHz)<\/li><li>RAM: 64 bytes, 2 kB VRAM (2\u00d7128\u00d764 bits)<\/li><li>Resolution: 128 \u00d7 64 pixels, 102 \u00d7 58 pixels visible<\/li><li>Colors: eight colors (either black\/white or four color max. per line)<\/li><li>Audio: 500 Hz, 1 kHz, and 1.5 kHz tones (can be modulated quickly to produce different tones)<\/li><li>Input: two custom game controllers, hardwired to the console<\/li><li>Output: RF modulated composite video signal, cord hardwired to console<\/li><\/ul>",

            "description": "<h2>Overview<\/h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">ColecoVision is a video game console made by Coleco Industries. It was released in August of 1982. It was a home system with arcade type games. It also featured the strange ability to play Atari 2600 games, its competitor. About 120 titles were released for the ColecoVision during its lifespan.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The ColecoVision came with the game Nintendo's Donkey Kong as a pack-in game and is revered as a near-perfect arcade port. This increased the popularity of the ColecoVision and by the end of 1982 the ColecoVision had sold 500,000 units. Atari's marketing for a short time claimed the 5200 was more powerful, but ColecoVision did much better than the Atari 5200 in sales, and since the 5200 was based on the Atari 400\/800 which was 3 years older, this claim didn't appear to hold much truth. Although the ColecoVision, at the time showed great sales and growth, the Atari 2600 still ruled the roost. The growth of the ColecoVision and the huge install base of the Atari 2600 helped start the first true Multi-platform movement in consoles. Activision, Parker Brothers, and several other companies for a short time released some titles on near the same launch day for both consoles. The ColecoVision eventually sold more the one million units by 1983.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Outside of the United States, the ColecoVision is known as the CBS ColecoVision as it was distributed by CBS Electronics.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The ColecoVision was discontinued in 1984 due to the crash of the video game market in 1983.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The ColecoVision had three different expansion peripherals:<\/p><ul><li><b>Expansion Module #1<\/b>: This allowed the ColecoVision to play Atari 2600 games which largely expanded the ColecoVision game library.<\/li><li><b>Expansion Module #2:<\/b> This was a driving controller that came with the pack-in game Turbo.

Following the absolute failure of the Commodore Plus\/4 line, and the <a href=\"\/amiga\/3045-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-1\">Commodore Amiga<\/a> struggling in the midst of growing market competition as well as an anemic marketing campaign by Commodore the need for a new and more successful line of Commodore computers on par with the <a href=\"\/commodore-64\/3045-14\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64<\/a> (C64) was apparent. However things were quickly becoming more and more difficult for Commodore management to design and market a new computer. Firstly CBM was dealing with a management crises following the loss of the visionary, albeit controversial, <a href=\"\/jack-tramiel\/3040-98032\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-98032\">Jack Tramiel<\/a> and his ascension to the top position at Atari (CBM\u2019s prime competitor following <a href=\"\/apple-inc\/3010-5815\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-5815\">Apple<\/a> and <a href=\"\/ibm\/3010-190\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-190\">IBM<\/a>). With that the new management lacked the vision and business experience that allowed Tramiel to make CBM the dominate force in the PC market. Couple this with increased market competition CBM was quickly loosing its market dominance in the personal computer market. Companies such as Apple, IBM, and Atari were quickly making a dent in CBM's foothold. As such financially CBM was not on the solid ground that it was accustomed to.<\/p><p>It was under these troubled circumstances that Commodore Business Machines decided to invest the money to design and market the Commodore 128 (C128). In doing so they had hoped to regain their foothold in the personal computer market and finally restore their dominance from back when the C64 had first debuted.<\/p><h2>Design<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679245-bilherd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1679245\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5452436194896\" data-width=\"431\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 431px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679245-bilherd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1679245\"><img alt=\"Bill Herd, the Mastermind Behind the C128.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679245-bilherd.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679245-bilherd.jpg 431w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px\" data-width=\"431\"><\/a><figcaption>Bill Herd, the Mastermind Behind the C128.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The design of the C128 was the brainchild of computer engineer Bil Herd. A young and up and coming engineer Bil Herd had quickly ascended to the Lead Engineering position in Commodore for his vocal and vehement criticism of the Plus\/4 management team. From the start Herd learned from the Plus\/4 line\u2019s greatest mistake and made full compatibility with C64 software a feature in the C128 from the start. As such it could play any cartridges intended for the C64 and could understand any code programmed in older versions of Commodore Basic.<\/p><p>One of the most important aspects of the C128\u2019s design was the fact that it utilized multiple central processing units to allow for multiple applications. The C128 had two CPUs: a 2 MHz MOS 8502 processor and a 4 MHz Zilog Z80A processor. While the C128 had multiple processors this does not mean that it was a true multiprocessor as the C128 was unable to utilize both processors simultaneously. There was a reason for this. Lead engineer Herd used the MOS processor to run the C64 and C128 mode whereas the Zilog processor ran the CP\/M mode. CP\/M was a popular operating system specifically designed for business functions and applications. In the minds of Commodore\u2019s management team by having business functions integrated into the C128 allowed for them to market the C128 as a versatile all purpose PC. In order to boot up this mode a user was required to insert a CP\/M boot up disk. However a consequence of this design meant that the C128 was an expensive and complex computer to manufacture.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679248-c128_80col_basic_screen_shot.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1679248\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.38191881918819\" data-width=\"542\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 542px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:38.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679248-c128_80col_basic_screen_shot.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1679248\"><img alt=\"The C128 Basic Start Up Screen\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px\" data-width=\"542\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679248-c128_80col_basic_screen_shot.gif\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679248-c128_80col_basic_screen_shot.gif 542w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/8273\/1679248-c128_80col_basic_screen_shot.gif 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The C128 Basic Start Up Screen\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679248-c128_80col_basic_screen_shot.gif\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679248-c128_80col_basic_screen_shot.gif 542w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/8273\/1679248-c128_80col_basic_screen_shot.gif 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px\" data-width=\"542\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The C128 Basic Start Up Screen<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>As for the specifications for the C128 it was an improvement across all boards in comparison to the C64. It had an MOS 8563 integrated circuit which had 16 colors and used an improved SIDs chip which was capable of 4 waves. It also had an impressive amount of RAM for a computer at the time. However getting to this point proved to be a difficult and costly experience for everyone involved in Commodore. The multiple processor design led to many issues that Bil Herd\u2019s engineering team struggled to deal with. Many prototypes (even in the later design stage) had the catastrophic tendency to catch on fire or explode. Not only was that but the yield on their video cards was extremely low for their prototypes (as low .01%). Due to facing many processor bugs the production was delayed and expensive and the engineering team barely made CES 1985 reveal.<\/p><h2>Marketing<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679240-c128_ad_vs_apple_iic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1679240\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3433835845896\" data-width=\"597\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 597px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679240-c128_ad_vs_apple_iic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1679240\"><img alt=\"A Marketing Poster Directed at the Apple II\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px\" data-width=\"597\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679240-c128_ad_vs_apple_iic.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679240-c128_ad_vs_apple_iic.jpg 597w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Marketing Poster Directed at the Apple II\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679240-c128_ad_vs_apple_iic.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679240-c128_ad_vs_apple_iic.jpg 597w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px\" data-width=\"597\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A Marketing Poster Directed at the Apple II<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The technical complexity of the C128 not only led to engineering issues but also marketing issues. The idea of a computer being a multi-functioning unit was still a new concept for the PC market as many consumers still owned or used specialized business computers for work and simple computers for home. Despite the versatility of the C128 CBM believed that marketing the C128 to the business computing market would be the most fruitful. However this deprived the C128 the mass appeal that allowed for the C64 to become the best selling computer in the mid eighties. By denying the C128 from becoming a gaming platform Commodore management also prevented it from being marketed as the \u201cfamily\u201d system that had really also allowed for the C64 to gain the mass appeal that made it the system seller and encouraged video game development for the computer. Also worth noting was that while it was present, the marketing campaign for the C128 was anemic and an all around weak effort by all accounts on the part of CBM management. Due to management not having the energetic driving force that Jack Tramiel provided during his time at the company the marketing was unable to really grab the attention of consumers like the C64 did.<\/p><p>Despite the fact that the C128 was an expensive computer to manufacture Commodore was fearful that if they were to price the C128 too high it would encroach on the Amiga\u2019s high end personal computer market. As such the C128 was priced at $299.95 and the improved and updated 128D was priced at $499.95. This was despite the fact that it cost as much to manufacture as the Amiga 500 which was priced at $595.95. This meant that Commodore was marketing an under-priced graphical power-horse to businesses and families that didn\u2019t need the multitasking or applications that the C128 had. It should be noted that the business computer market and family computer market were already inundated with cheap albeit more specialized varieties. As a result by being a mismarketed jack of all trades the C128 failed to appeal to any one market.<\/p><h2>Software Support<\/h2><p>As for video game developer support for the C128, it was a lack luster affair. Part of the reason for this was that the C128 was design specifically with the business market in mind and with the gaming scene as an afterthought. In total less than 50 games were released for the C128. In comparison to the C64 having over 10,000 commercial software titles published for it (over 2,000 which were video games), a significant failure for the C128. Similarly whereas the C64 and to a greater extent the Amiga where able to carve an active demo scene in the computer hobby world no such support would develop for the C128.<\/p><h2>Market Reception<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679242-c128_retail.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1679242\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.92901234567901\" data-width=\"324\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 324px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679242-c128_retail.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1679242\"><img alt=\"The C128 Retail Package\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px\" data-width=\"324\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679242-c128_retail.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679242-c128_retail.jpg 324w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The C128 Retail Package\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679242-c128_retail.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8273\/1679242-c128_retail.jpg 324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px\" data-width=\"324\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The C128 Retail Package<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In total by the end of its production the C128 sold around four million units. While by no means a failure in comparison to the C64\u2019s approximately 17,000,000 sold the C128\u2019s market performance came as a disappointment to the management team at Commodore. As previously noted due to the C128\u2019s low price Commodore Business Machines received a lower than usual profit per unit when C128s were initially being sold. Also worth noting is that the C128 was seen as the last computer that utilized CP\/M. In less than a year after it was released CP\/M use was being replaced by major businesses in favor of Microsoft DOS. As such Commodore\u2019s hope that they would carve out a base in the business computer market completely failed.<\/p><h2>Legacy<\/h2><p>The disappointing performance of the C128 as well as the Amiga line struggling to maintain dominance marked the beginning of the end for Commodore Business Machines. While the company was once the manufacturer of the most popular line of personal computers in the United States and worldwide their management struggles and inability to deal with the changing personal computer market would market the death note for CBM. This machine would be Commodores' last 8-Bit computer; after this they would produce only 16\/32 bit Amiga's and IBM PC clones. Five years following the discontinuation of the C128 line CBM would file for bankruptcy and sell the Amiga line to German PC manufacturer Escom.<br \/><br \/><\/p><h2>Technical Specifications<\/h2><table data-max-width=\"true\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Processors<\/strong><\/td><td><ul><li>MOS 8502 @ 2 MHz<\/li><li>Zilog Z80 @ 4 MHz<\/li><\/ul><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>RAM<\/strong><\/td><td><ul><li>128 kB system RAM<\/li><li>2 kB 4-bit dedicated color RAM<\/li><li>16 or 64 kB dedicated video RAM<\/li><li>up to 512 kB REU expansion RAM<\/li><\/ul><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>ROM<\/strong><\/td><td>72 kB<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics<\/strong><\/td><td><ul><li>MOS 8564\/8566 VIC-II E for 40-column composite video<\/li><li>MOS 8563 VDC for 80-column digital RGBI component video<\/li><\/ul><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Display<\/strong><\/td><td>Text Mode: 80x25 or 80x50, 16 RGBI colors<br \/>Graphics Mode: 320x200, 640x200, or 640x400 (interlaced)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Sound<\/strong><\/td><td>MOS 6581 SID synthesizer chip<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Ports<\/strong><\/td><td>Serial, video (composite), RF video (TV)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>",

SID (itself an acronym for Sound Interface Device) was created by Robert Yannes, an engineer who later moved to the synthesizer industry. Yannes stated that he felt previous computer sound chips had been designed by people who did not understand music, and sought to design a chip that would be useful for musicians. Previously, there had been a single chip for both audio and video, so a dedicated chip for audio provided musicians with much more freedom and range.<\/p><p>The initial run of the SID chip, the SID 6581, was extremely popular, and instrumental in the success of the Commodore 64. It allowed for much more freedom comparative to previous chips, such as three oscillators, each of which could produce four separate waveforms. Additionally, many composers were able to find loopholes to make their music even more complex, such as a glitch that essentially created a fourth channel for 4-bit samples. Some games that took advantage of this were <a href=\"\/impossible-mission\/3030-14849\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14849\">Impossible Mission<\/a> and <a href=\"\/ghostbusters\/3030-11874\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11874\">Ghostbusters<\/a>, both of which used voice samples.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1843060-0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1843060\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1843060-0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1843060\"><img alt=\"Many cracktros, such as this one, took advantage of the SID's capabilities\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1843060-0.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1843060-0.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1843060-0.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Many cracktros, such as this one, took advantage of the SID's capabilities\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1843060-0.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1843060-0.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1843060-0.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Many cracktros, such as this one, took advantage of the SID's capabilities<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Many well-known composers and developers had their start with the SID chip, such as <a href=\"\/rob-hubbard\/3040-2834\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-2834\">Rob Hubbard<\/a> and <a href=\"\/martin-galway\/3040-5357\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-5357\">Martin Galway<\/a>.

The composition process was initially very rough; composers would have to input a sequence of hexadecimal bytes where each line would describe the note, pitch, length, etc. of the sound being played.<\/p><p>By the mid-1980s, SID musicians were improving to a point where they could effectively emulate \"real\" music. Games such as <a href=\"\/times-of-lore\/3030-6900\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6900\">Times of Lore<\/a> were able to use mainstream songs as inspiration, and adapt that to a SID song. Also at this time, demo groups began to rise in popularity, with several Commodore 64 magazines releasing songs from their readers. The impact of SID music is evident as well, with songs still being developed to this day. While many musicians utilize emulation, some continue to use the original SID chips.<\/p>",

It is famous for being the first console to include worldwide online capability, its game library, and its unexpectedly short life span.",
            "description": "<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>The Sega Dreamcast is a 128-bit console released in 1998 and the successor to the <a href=\"\/saturn\/3045-42\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-42\">Sega Saturn<\/a>. The Dreamcast was based on the powerful Sega Naomi <a href=\"\/arcade\/3045-84\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade<\/a> system (released 1998), the successor to the Sega Model 3 arcade system (released 1996). The Dreamcast uses a Hitachi CPU processor, the first with a 128-bit vector graphics engine, along with an <a href=\"\/nec-home-electronics-ltd\/3010-2708\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2708\">NEC<\/a> GPU graphics processor. It had a new disc format in the shape of the GD-ROM; these discs held up to 1.2 gigabytes of data, considerably more than a <a href=\"\/compact-disc\/3055-2133\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2133\">Compact Disc<\/a>. The Dreamcast was <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega<\/a>'s last entry to the console hardware market as their support for the console ended as early as 2001, less than two years after the <a href=\"\/the-united-states-of-america\/3035-396\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">US <\/a>launch, and is largely attributed to the arrival of the hotly anticipated and wildly successful <a href=\"\/playstation-2\/3045-19\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PS2<\/a>. Despite its tragically short life, the Dreamcast is held in high regard by nostalgic fans for the raft of superb exclusive titles released in that time.<\/p><h2>History<\/h2><h3>1995 - 1998: Before the Dreamcast<\/h3><p>The <a href=\"\/saturn\/3045-42\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-42\">Saturn<\/a> originated in 1995 at the first <a href=\"\/e3-1995\/3015-3482\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3482\">E3<\/a>. Since Sony's arrival in the game hardware market, their rivals began playing a major defensive against the juggernaut that was the PlayStation. The growing popularity of the <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation<\/a> brought a lot of support from <a href=\"\/japan\/3035-37\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan<\/a>, and the <a href=\"\/saturn\/3045-42\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-42\">Saturn<\/a> began to slip behind in sales. Due to this, Sega began to fear that Sony would gain momentous support in the US and would leave them lagging seriously behind. In order to keep up, Sega made a marketing decision, which has infamously become widely considered to be a historic mistake in its battle for supremacy.<\/p><p>At E3, Sega announced that the Saturn was released the same day as the press conference in the US. Their strategy was to release the console early so they could get a strong base before Sony released their console in September. This plan backfired due to the anger of developers and retailers. Many developers were mad because they wanted their games to be released with the Saturn's launch, and many popular retailers (like Wal-Mart and KB Toys) were so angry for lack of information that most considered not selling any more Sega consoles in their stores. The Saturn sold 80,000 units before the PlayStation launched, but the PlayStation sold over 100,000 units during its first week, making Sega's strategy a failure. Even though the Saturn was managing to keep up in Japan, it completely bombed in the US. The only territory where the Saturn had any success was Japan, where it was Sega's most successful console in its home country.<\/p><p>Overseas, however, things did not get better for Sega over the next two years. At <a href=\"\/e3-1997\/3015-3419\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3419\">E3 1997<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/bernard-stolar\/3040-33719\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-33719\">Bernie Stolar<\/a> announced \"The Saturn is not our future\". This announcement, for all intents and purposes, killed the Saturn's overseas chances, and made people even more angry because of this. Thus, Sega began work on a new console.<\/p><h3>Development<\/h3><p>The company wanted to create a truly next-generation console, with features ahead of its time and far superior hardware to that of the popular PlayStation as well as the Nintendo 64. As a result, the Dreamcast, based on the powerful Sega Naomi arcade system, was the first console to truly offer <a href=\"\/arcade\/3045-84\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade<\/a>-quality <a href=\"\/polygonal-3d\/3015-1430\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">3D graphics<\/a>, considerably more powerful than any other home system when it launched in 1998.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the desire to get the Dreamcast moving quickly and have a fast production process may have eventually led to its demise, since, as the technology behind it being considerable powerful for a 1998 system, it was far too expensive to produce, forcing Sega to sell it at a loss. In addition, this may have put it at a mid-way point between generations, competing against the much weaker <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">Playstation<\/a> and <a href=\"\/nintendo-64\/3045-43\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">N64<\/a> in its early years, before eventually competing against the <a href=\"\/playstation-2\/3045-19\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PS2<\/a> which had comparable graphical capabilities (though both consoles were weaker than the <a href=\"\/xbox\/3045-32\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox<\/a> and <a href=\"\/gamecube\/3045-23\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">Gamecube<\/a> by 2001).<\/p><p>There were initially two competing models of the Dreamcast. Tatsuo Yamamoto of IBM Austin was to lead a team of eleven developing the \"Black Belt\" version of the console, which was to have a Hitachi SH4 processor and a 3dfx Voodoo 2 graphics chip. At various stages in development, the US model was nicknamed \"Shark\" and \"Dural\". Meanwhile, the Japanese hardware team led by Hideki Sato settled on the same processor, but a PowerVR2 graphics chip created by VideoLogic and manufactured by NEC. This \"White Belt\" version was nicknamed \"Guppy\" and \"Katana\" before the name Dreamcast was decided. The Japanese model was chosen in Summer 1997 because 3dfx had unwittingly leaked its entire contract with Sega in April, who had been keeping the project a secret. 3dfx filed a lawsuit against Sega for breach of contract, but this was settled out of court.<\/p><h3>Success<\/h3><p>On November 27, 1998, The <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega<\/a> Dreamcast launched in Japan. The console was in high demand throughout the region, causing it to sell out in all stores during its first few weeks of launch. It was selling so well that Sega couldn't keep up with the demand. According to reports, NEC was unable to create enough processors for the Dreamcast so Sega was unable to make as many consoles as they would liked.<\/p><p>Seeing how successful the Dreamcast had done in Japan, Sega began work on an American release. Sega of America was hard at work on getting buzz for the American Dreamcast launch. Sega even created their own holiday called \"Dreamcast Day\", set for September 9, 1999, burning 9-9-99 into everyone's memory as the day they'd get to experience the next generation of gaming for the first time. The subsequent European release date was on October 14, 1999.<\/p><p>The Dreamcast continued to sell well in North America until 2000. In fact, the Dreamcast even managed to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netinst.org\/Clements_Ohashi.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">outsell the PS2 in North America<\/a> in 2000 (possibly due to PS2 shortages), shortly before the console was discontinued. However, this was not enough to resolve the problems Sega were facing, as outlined below.<\/p><h3>Downfall<\/h3><p>At <a href=\"\/e3-1999\/3015-3421\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3421\">E3 1999<\/a>, Sega was showing the Dreamcast and its games to the American market. However, Sega's biggest threat, Sony, unveiled the Playstation 2, showing the complete layout and design of the console. From what Sony showed, it was clear that the Playstation 2 was a more powerful system in comparison to the Dreamcast. Due to this, consumers decided to skip the Dreamcast and wait for the PS2 to come out. These turn of events began to shake the foundation of the Dreamcast.<\/p><p>Even though the PS2 had the most attention at that moment, the Dreamcast had a successful launch, selling 300,000 pre-orders, which was more than the original Playstation. The Dreamcast had a vast variety of launch games like <a href=\"\/sonic-adventure\/3030-7852\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7852\">Sonic Adventure<\/a>, <a href=\"\/soul-calibur\/3030-12411\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12411\">Soul Calibur<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/nfl-2k2\/3030-14001\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14001\">NFL 2K<\/a>. For a while it seemed that Sega would continue to be a competitor in the gaming market.<\/p><p>Then in March of 2000, Sony released the PS2 worldwide to considerable hype. One major plus that the PS2 had was the game console doubled as a DVD player. Back then, DVDs weren't popular because standalone DVD players were too expensive for the average consumer. Since the PS2 was less expensive than a stand alone DVD player, the PS2 sold very well and helped boost the DVD platform. There were instances reported where people didn't even buy the console for games (the launch didn't have as many good games as the Dreamcast), and solely used the console for the DVD player functionality. To show support of this, the best selling item for the PS2 in Japan was the Matrix DVD. This made the PS2 look more like an entertainment device than an actual console. Since the Dreamcast couldn't play DVDs, people overlooked the system and Dreamcast consoles were beginning to sit on shelves.<\/p><p>One other problem the Dreamcast had was copious amounts of pirating. Because of the Dreamcast's poor copy protection, it was easy for people to copy games onto regular CD-ROM's and have the console recognize them as actual games. Because of this, game sales were decreasing.<\/p><p>Despite the considerable hype for the PS2, the Dreamcast in fact managed to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netinst.org\/Clements_Ohashi.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">outsell the PS2 in North America<\/a> (possibly due to PS2 shortages) in 2000. However, this was not enough to make up for the losses in both hardware (selling at a loss) and software sales (much of which was being pirated), sealing the fate of Sega.<\/p><p>Sega got some relief when Sony was only able to sell half their inventory of PS2 consoles. Since the PS2's inventory was so weak, Sega decided to take action and try to move mass quantities of units. Unfortunately, this plan backfired as well.<\/p><p>In March 2001, <a href=\"\/peter-moore\/3040-14816\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-14816\">Peter Moore<\/a> (the head of Sega of America at the time) announced that the Dreamcast hadn't been meeting expectations. The sales had been sadly lagging and their warehouses were filled with unsold Dreamcast consoles and games. Sega decided to sell off the remaining number of consoles at a vastly discounted price and cut their losses. As part of this restructuring Sega announced that the Dreamcast would be discontinued and that they would exit the hardware business. Furthermore they would also be porting several of their key Dreamcast exclusives to rival platforms.<\/p><p>The change was meant to happen slowly with Sega continuing to release software for the system into 2002. However with Sega games now on other platforms third parties weren't all that thrilled to be supporting it. By fall of 2001 the new game output was dismal with only a handful of exclusives, most of which tanked and were never heard from again.<\/p><h2>Hardware<\/h2><p>Back in 1998, the Dreamcast was an advanced console for its time, surpassing the capabilities of all other consoles available at the time of its release and being the first 128-bit console to be released. The console has 4 controller slots and a 56k modem built into the console for Seganet. A broadband adapter for a faster connection was also available for $50, allowing the Dreamcast to be connected to an ethernet network.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1680286-dc_acc_broadband.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1680286\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0815789473684\" data-width=\"380\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 380px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1680286-dc_acc_broadband.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1680286\"><img alt=\"Broadband Adapter for the Sega Dreamcast\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1680286-dc_acc_broadband.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1680286-dc_acc_broadband.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\" data-width=\"591\"><\/a><figcaption>Broadband Adapter for the Sega Dreamcast<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Dreamcast supported multiple television connections. It shipped with standard A\/V cables, and S-video, component RGB cables, and an RF connector were available separately. In addition, Sega released a VGA adapter that allowed the Dreamcast to be played on a computer monitor at a resolution of 640x480, four times the standard resolution. Certain games could not be played through the VGA adapter, however.<\/p><p>This console runs GD-Roms which could hold up to 1.2 GBs of space. It also uses VMU memory cards that could hold up to 128 KB of space. These VMUs connect to your Dreamcast controller and have an LCD screen that shows pictures relating to the game that you're playing. For some games, minigames relating to the games are saved onto the VMU which could be played without the use of the Dreamcast, making it a handheld console as well.<\/p><h2>Accessories<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1680273-samba.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1680273\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"360\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1680273-samba.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1680273\"><img alt=\"Samba de Amigo Maracas\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/121177\/1680273-samba.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1680273-samba.jpg 360w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/121177\/1680273-samba.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Samba de Amigo Maracas<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Dreamcast had a lot of accessories.

For the <a href=\"\/sonic-the-hedgehog\/3025-383\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-383\">Sonic<\/a> fans, there was <a href=\"\/sonic-adventure\/3030-7852\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7852\">Sonic Adventure<\/a>, which was Sega's first successful attempt into bring Sonic's gameplay to 3D. For the fighting fanatics, there was <a href=\"\/soul-calibur\/3030-12411\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12411\">Soul Calibur<\/a>, which was a 3D fighter (similar to <a href=\"\/tekken\/3030-10081\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10081\">Tekken<\/a>) that uses swords as their main weapons. This game became a big success, scoring 10's from many game reviewers (IGN and Gamespot) and is considered to be the superior version in comparison to the arcade game. For sports fans, there was <a href=\"\/nfl-2k\/3030-4659\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4659\">NFL 2K<\/a>, the football title. When EA announced that they would not develop for the Dreamcast due to the failure of the Saturn, this caused Sega to make their own sports titles. NFL 2K was the Dreamcast's answer to <a href=\"\/madden-nfl\/3025-491\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-491\">Madden<\/a> and also made other sports titles for the <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/nba-2k\/3025-498\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-498\">NBA<\/a> and <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/nhl-2k\/3025-473\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-473\">NHL<\/a> as well as <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/virtua-tennis\/3030-10676\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10676\">Virtua Tennis<\/a>, their own tennis game. Later installments would include online play.<\/p><p>Due to a lack of third party support, Sega focused on their first party titles. Sega would continue to release their 2K sports line and would add online play to the 2K1 installments. Sega ported many of their popular arcade games over to the Dreamcast like <a href=\"\/crazy-taxi\/3030-9112\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9112\">Crazy Taxi<\/a> and <a href=\"\/the-house-of-the-dead\/3030-508\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-508\">House of the Dead<\/a>. Along with their arcade games came their original, innovative titles for the platform. One of them was <a href=\"\/samba-de-amigo\/3030-16519\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16519\">Samba de Amigo<\/a>, a rhythm game where you use a controller shaped like Maracas to move your arms around to meet a certain position. <a href=\"\/space-channel-5\/3030-7466\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7466\">Space Channel 5<\/a> was another rhythm game where you go around space killing aliens while dancing to pop music. <a href=\"\/chuchu-rocket\/3030-13715\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13715\">Chu Chu Rocket<\/a> was a puzzle game where you lead a group of mice away from cats.<\/p><p>Although the Dreamcast didn't have a high amount of third party support, the people who did develop for the system released top-notched games. The biggest company to do this was <a href=\"\/capcom\/3010-367\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-367\">Capcom<\/a>. Capcom was well known for its fighters released for the Dreamcast. They would make definitive home ports of their popular arcade fighters ( <a href=\"\/marvel-vs-capcom\/3025-513\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-513\">Marvel vs. Capcom<\/a> <a href=\"\/marvel-vs-capcom-clash-of-super-heroes\/3030-8605\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8605\">1<\/a> and <a href=\"\/marvel-vs-capcom-2-new-age-of-heroes\/3030-2612\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2612\">2<\/a>) along with releasing brand new fighters exclusive for the console ( <a href=\"\/power-stone\/3030-20100\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20100\">Power Stone<\/a>).<\/p><p>The biggest game released for the Dreamcast was <a href=\"\/shenmue\/3030-7812\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7812\">Shenmue<\/a>. It was in development since the Sega Saturn and was made by <a href=\"\/yu-suzuki\/3040-15149\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-15149\">Yu Suzuki<\/a>. It was considered to be the most expensive game (costing $70 million) and the most graphically superior game at the time. The game added some new elements like free-roaming gameplay and time-based gameplay. It was hyped to be the killer app for the Dreamcast that would ruin the PS2. When the game was first released in 2001, it came with mixed reviews. Some game reviewers loved the game, giving it 9's and 10's. They consider it a gaming achievement with its deep story and innovative gameplay. Others completely hated the game, giving it low scores. They complained about the slow gameplay and cheesy voice acting. Due to the mixed reviews, the game sold poorly. A <a href=\"\/shenmue-ii\/3030-1187\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1187\">sequel<\/a> was released in Japan for the Dreamcast in 2001, but it never came to the US. In 2002, Sega made a deal with Microsoft to release the sequel for the Xbox in 2002.<\/p><h2>Online<\/h2><p>The Dreamcast was the first console to have fully functioning online play. The system came with a 56K modem and for families who didn't have an ISP Sega created the Seganet service (although players with an ISP already could use their own).<\/p><p>Although online play wasn't available untill fall of 2000, players could surf and browse the web through the console from day one. Some games even offered a rudimentry form of downloadable content. In Sonic Adventure, for instance players could download holiday themes for levels.<\/p><h2>Legacy<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1680287\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1680287\"><img alt=\"The Dreamcast\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/121177\/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/121177\/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/121177\/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/121177\/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Dreamcast\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/121177\/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/121177\/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/121177\/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/121177\/1680287-dreamcast_logo.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Dreamcast<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Even though the Dreamcast was discontinued prematurely, the legacy of the console lives on. Due to the Dreamcast failing, Sega had to drop from the console race and begin to make games for other consoles. Most of those games, early on, were ports of Dreamcast games. The two Sonic Adventure games were ported over to the Nintendo Gamecube, which was shocking at the time due to Sega and Nintendo's strong rivalry during the 90s. The Gamecube even got Phantasy Star Online, being one of the only Gamecube games to support online play.<\/p><p>Sony, the people whom many claimed to cause Sega to leave the hardware business, got <a href=\"\/virtua-fighter-4\/3030-4313\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4313\">Virtua Fighter 4<\/a> for the PS2. Peter Moore, Sega of America's president at the time, left Sega to join Microsoft and help with their new console, the Xbox. Due to him being a part of Sega, he got Sega to make games on the Xbox. They got some exclusive games like <a href=\"\/jsrf-jet-set-radio-future\/3030-12117\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12117\">Jet Set Radio Future<\/a>, <a href=\"\/panzer-dragoon-orta\/3030-4535\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4535\">Panzer Dragoon Orta<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/shenmue-ii\/3030-1187\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1187\">Shenmue II<\/a>.<\/p><p>Many popular Dreamcast games would be later ported to HD platforms such as the <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/xbox-360\/3045-20\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/playstation-3\/3045-35\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">Playstation 3<\/a>, and the <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a>.

Its claim to fame was that its games were released on a medium similar to floppy disks. The disks, having two sides, originally contained more space than what a Famicom cartridge was capable of holding. They were also much cheaper to produce, a characteristic meant to lure developers to the platform. The Famicom also features a microphone in the controller, which certain games used, such as an updated version of the original Zelda. Despite the Disk System's moderate success, the majority of the Famicom's library still remained in cartridge form exclusively. Nevertheless, several of Nintendo's series were started on the Famicom Disk System and later entries in the series were available on more mainstream Nintendo platforms.<\/p><h2>The Disk<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1751015-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1751015\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.196\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:119.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1751015-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1751015\"><img alt=\"A yellow famicom disk system game\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1751015-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1751015-1.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"><\/a><figcaption>A yellow famicom disk system game<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Famicom Disk System's games contained internal features impossible to replicate on cartridges. The most notable of these features was their rewriting capability. Aside from being applied to conventional tasks, such as saving progress, certain disks could also have their games entirely overwritten for a small fee.<\/p><p>The disks themselves were either a yellow or blue color and have the word Nintendo etched in at the bottom, with the blue version containing a shutter, whereas the yellow does not. Most disks have stickers on both sides that contain the title of the game as well as a large \"A\" or \"B\" (alternatively \"Side A\" or \"Side B\") on the left side of the sticker which tells the player the side of the disk. Typically the player needs to put Side A in first to boot up the game and once they start a game or load a saved file a message will appear on the screen telling the player to switch sides. At this point the player needs to eject the disk and flip it over to side B to start the game. Some disks are one sided meaning side B is blank and doesn't have a sticker on it. Games that have a blank side B do not need to be flipped over at any point.<\/p><h2>Sharp Twin Famicom<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1757570-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1757570\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.46650717703349\" data-width=\"418\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 418px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:46.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1757570-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1757570\"><img alt=\"Twin Famicom\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/1757570-1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1757570-1.jpg 418w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/1757570-1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Twin Famicom\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/1757570-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1757570-1.jpg 418w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/1757570-1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Twin Famicom<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Sharp Corporation released the Twin Famicom in Japan on July 1, 1986, less than five months after the release of the Famicom Disk System. The Twin Famicom combines the Famicom and Famicom Disk System into one system and is officially licensed by Nintendo. The system has a switch just below the cartridge slot that allows the player to switch between using the Disk System or the Famicom. When switched to the Disk System the cartridge slot locks to prevent players from attempting to use both slots at the same time. Similarly, if switched to the Famicom the Disk System slot locks for the same reason.<\/p><p>The original release of the system came in two different colors red with black highlights or black with red highlights. There was also a re-release that came in a slightly different case design, turbo controllers, and two new sets of color schemes. The first color scheme is black with green highlights and the second is red with blue and gray highlights.<\/p><h2>Overseas Conversions<\/h2><p>Because Nintendo opted to not distribute the Famicom Disk System outside of Japan, all of its games which received international releases required technical modifications so that they could function on regular cartridges. Ultimately few of these games retained their ability to save games due to the costs of incorporating batteries into the cartridges. ( <a href=\"\/the-legend-of-zelda\/3030-11949\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\">The Legend of Zelda<\/a> is one exception, as it still employed battery-backed saving.)

The game which was chosen to do this was <a href=\"\/yume-kojo-doki-doki-panic\/3030-21469\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21469\">Doki Doki Panic<\/a>, an Arabian-themed platformer which had been produced for a television station's special event.

The first computer with a standard CD-ROM drive, it had many CD enhanced versions of Eastern and Western games (including action, adventure and RPG titles) which are sought after to this day by collectors. Its console version, FM Towns Marty, released in 1993 as the first 5th-gen console.",
            "description": "<p>FM Towns is a proprietary 32-bit computer system manufactured by <a href=\"\/fujitsu\/3010-6596\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6596\">Fujitsu<\/a>. It was released in <a href=\"\/japan\/3035-37\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan<\/a> only, in February 1989, as the successor to the <a href=\"\/fm-7\/3045-114\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-114\">FM-7<\/a> computer platform. The FM Towns had a launch price of \u00a5400,000 (over $3000 in 1989 dollars, equivalent to nearly $6000 in 2013 dollars). While it was never officially released outside Japan, imports of the FM Towns were available, particularly in the <a href=\"\/united-kingdom\/3035-492\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-492\">UK<\/a>. When it first released, the FM Towns was one of the most advanced <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a> platforms released up until then, rivalled only by the <a href=\"\/sharp-x68000\/3045-95\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-95\">Sharp X68000<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Overview<\/h2><p>FM Towns was considerably advanced for its time. At launch in 1989, it was using a 32-bit Intel 80386DX CPU (later upgraded to Pentium CPU in early 90's), supported 24-bit colour which could display up to 16.78 million colours, featured high-resolution display modes up to 1024x1024 pixels, and featured the unique ability to overlay two different display modes.<\/p><p>It has a built in <a href=\"\/compact-disc\/3055-2133\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2133\">CD-ROM<\/a> drive as standard, which was many years ahead of its time. Also ahead of its time was its ability to boot directly to a CD version of its operating system, TownsOS. This was a full 8 years before Microsoft thought of doing the same thing. As well as being able to run the TownsOS graphical user interface, it had versions of Windows 3, 3.1 and Windows 95 as they became available.<\/p><p>Games were a strong point of the system as they could be greatly enhanced by the startlingly increased capacity of CDs over floppy discs.<\/p><p>Games were usually enhanced in one or more of the following ways:<\/p><ul><li>Near <a href=\"\/arcade\/3045-84\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade<\/a>-quality ports, instead of inferior conversions on other home systems (with the exception of the <a href=\"\/sharp-x68000\/3045-95\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-95\">Sharp X68000<\/a> computer and <a href=\"\/neo-geo\/3045-25\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-25\">Neo Geo<\/a> console). At release, it was a very powerful system.<\/li><li>Containing <a href=\"\/voice-acting\/3015-1413\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1413\">voiced<\/a> speech and <a href=\"\/full-motion-video\/3015-604\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-604\">full-motion video<\/a> <a href=\"\/cutscene\/3015-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscenes<\/a>, which was almost impossible on floppy and cartridge based systems.<\/li><li>'<a href=\"\/redbook-audio\/3015-6487\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6487\">Redbook<\/a>' CD music <a href=\"\/original-soundtrack-release\/3015-189\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-189\">soundtracks<\/a>, i.e. proper, non synthesised music that you can play on any CD player.<\/li><\/ul><p>As the system grew older, while IBM-compatible <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a>'s caught up, the versions of games became identical. For example, <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/wing-commander\/3025-212\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-212\">Wing Commander Origins<\/a> in 1993 was identical on PC and FM Towns. Considering the system had been out for 4 years, that was impressive.<\/p><p>In the Western world, the system is perhaps best known for having many CD enhanced ports or <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/remake\/3015-340\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-340\">remakes<\/a> (with improved graphics, audio, and interface) of classic Western RPG's and adventure games, such as the <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/ultima\/3025-247\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-247\">Ultima <\/a>series and <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc\/3010-644\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-644\">LucasArts<\/a> games, for example. The FM Towns versions are sometimes considered the best versions of these games.<\/p><h2>Technical specifications<\/h2><h3>Main processors<\/h3><ul><li>Main CPU: <ul><li>1989: Intel 80386DX (32-bit) @ 16 MHz<\/li><li>1993: Intel i486DX @ 33-66 MHz \/ Intel i486SX @ 25 MHz<\/li><li>1994: Intel i486DX @ 33-66 MHz \/ Intel i486SX @ 33 MHz<\/li><li>1995: Intel Pentium @ 90-120 MHz<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Upgradable CPU: <ul><li>1993: Intel OverDrive @ 66-100 MHz<\/li><li>1994: Intel Pentium @ 75-120 MHz \/ 486DX4 @ 75-100 MHz<\/li><li>1995: Intel Pentium @ 120-133 MHz<\/li><li>1996: Intel Pentium @ 133-200 MHz<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>FPU (floating point unit) arithmetic co-processor: Intel 80387 @ 16 MHz<\/li><\/ul><h3>Operating systems<\/h3><ul><li>Default: Towns OS (1989), Towns OS 2.1 (1995)<\/li><li>Supported: DOS\/V (1990), Windows 3.1 (1992), Windows 95 (1995)<\/li><\/ul><h3>Memory<\/h3><ul><li>Main RAM (Random Access Memory) <ul><li>Default: 1-2 MB (1989), 4 MB (1993), 6 MB (1994), 8-16 MB (1995)<\/li><li>Upgradable: 10 MB (1989), 64 MB (1993), 128 MB (1995)<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Video RAM (VRAM) memory: 656 KB <ul><li>Main VRAM: 512 KB<\/li><li>Sprite RAM: 128 KB (1024 sprites)<\/li><li>Text RAM: 16 KB<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Storage: CD-ROM (540 MB), 2x 3.5\" floppy disk (1.2 MB) drives, hard disk drive <ul><li>Optional storage: 5.25\" floppy disk drive, hard disk drive<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>CD-ROM drive speed: 1x (1989), 2x (1993), 4x (1995)<\/li><li>Hard disk drive: <ul><li>Default: 20-40 MB (1989), 170-340 MB (1993), 850 MB (1995)<\/li><li>Upgradable: 45 MB (1989), 3.2 GB (1997)<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><h3>Display<\/h3><ul><li>Display resolutions: 256x256, 320x240, 352x232, 360x240, 640x400, 640x480, 1024x768, 1024x1024, 1120x750<\/li><li>Colour palette: <ul><li>12-bit (4096 colours) @ 640x480 \/ 640x400 (2 planes)<\/li><li>15-bit (32,768 colours) @ 320x240 (2 planes)<\/li><li>24-bit (16.78 million colours) @ 640x480 (1 plane)<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Simultaneous colours: <ul><li>1989: <ul><li>4-bit (16 colours) @ 1024x1024 \/ 1120x750 (1 plane)<\/li><li>4-bit (16 colours) @ 640x480 \/ 640x400 (2 planes)<\/li><li>8-bit (256 colours) @ 640x480 (1 plane)<\/li><li>15-bit (32,768 colours) @ 320x240 (1 plane)<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>1994: 15-bit (32,768 colours) to 24-bit (16.78 million colours)<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Sprites: Up to 1024 sprites @ 16x16 pixels each<\/li><\/ul><h3>Audio<\/h3><ul><li>CD audio: 16-bit sampling @ 44.1 KHz, <a href=\"\/redbook-audio\/3015-6487\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6487\">Redbook<\/a> audio<\/li><li>FM synthesis audio: Yamaha YM2612 sound chip, 6-channel stereo<\/li><li>PCM audio: <ul><li>1989: Ricoh RF5c68 sound chip, 8-channel stereo, 8-bit sampling @ 19.2 Hz<\/li><li>1994: 16-bit sampling @ 48 KHz, stereo<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Optional sound card: Creative Sound Blaster AWE32 (1994)<\/li><\/ul><h3>Other specifications<\/h3><ul><li>Input: Keyboard, mouse, gamepad, joystick<\/li><li>Other options: Video card, microphone, <a href=\"\/online\/3015-559\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-559\">modem<\/a>, SCSI card, VGA card, <a href=\"\/multi-monitor-support\/3015-6433\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6433\">dual-monitor support<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h2>History<\/h2><p>The FM Towns' main 16\/32-bit rivals in the Japanese computer market were <a href=\"\/nec-home-electronics-ltd\/3010-2708\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2708\">NEC<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/nec-pc-9801\/3045-112\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-112\">PC-98<\/a> (launched 1982) and <a href=\"\/sharp-corporation\/3010-6509\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6509\">Sharp<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/sharp-x68000\/3045-95\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-95\">X68000<\/a> (launched 1987). The FM Towns had the best audio quality and multimedia capabilities upon release, and was second only to the X68000 in terms of power and graphical capabilities.<\/p><p>Despite this, the NEC PC-98 remained the market leader in Japan up until the mid-1990s, when the arrival of Windows 95 on <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">IBM-compatible PC<\/a>'s slowly began gaining rivalling the local Japanese competition around the late 1990s. Despite FM Towns supporting Windows 95, IBM-compatible PC's slowly came to dominate the Japanese computer market by the early 2000s. The mid-1990s is thus often seen as the end of the 'Golden Age' of Japanese computer gaming.<\/p><p>In 1993, Fujitsu released the a console version of the FM Towns called the FM Towns Marty, the first 32-bit console, beginning the fifth-generation of consoles in Japan a year before the launch of <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/saturn\/3045-42\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-42\">Saturn <\/a>and <a href=\"\/sony-computer-entertainment-incorporated\/3010-995\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-995\">Sony<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation<\/a>. A variant called the FM Towns Marty 2 was released the following year in 1994 that featured a darker grey shell and a lower price point but was otherwise the same as the original FM Towns Marty. The FM Towns Marty was also backwards compatible with FM Towns games.  <\/p><h2>External link<\/h2><ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/stream\/ace-magazine-27\/ACE_Issue_27_1989_Dec#page\/n27\/mode\/2up\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">ACE Magazine, Issue 27, article on FM Towns<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/museum.ipsj.or.jp\/en\/computer\/personal\/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">IPSJ Computer Museum<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.old-computers.com\/museum\/doc.asp?c=968\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Old Computers article<\/a><\/li><\/ul><p> <\/p>",

One such feature is F-BASIC, very similar to the CoCo's \"<a href=\"\/microsoft-studios\/3010-340\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft<\/a> CoCo BASIC.\" F-BASIC is essentially a simplistic programming language, including a katakana and kanji character set, graphics manipulation, and music.<\/p><h2>Model Variants<\/h2><p>There were several different versions of the FM-7 released following the initial release in 1982, including the FM-New 7 and FM-77.<\/p><p>A major breakthrough for computer gaming came in 1985, with the release of the FM-77 AV, the first computer model to break the 8-color barrier of 8-bit computers and achieve a simultaneous display of 4096 colors. In addition, the FM-77 AV also came with a built-in Yamaha FM synthesis sound board, providing higher-quality audio.<\/p><p>FM-7 models included:<\/p><ul><li><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/2115658-fujitsu_77av3c_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2115658\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.99551569506726\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:99.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/2115658-fujitsu_77av3c_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2115658\"><img alt=\"FM-77 AV\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/2115658-fujitsu_77av3c_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/2115658-fujitsu_77av3c_1.jpg 223w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px\" data-width=\"223\"><\/a><figcaption>FM-77 AV<\/figcaption><\/figure> FM-New 7 (1984)<\/li><li>FM-77 (1984)<\/li><li>FM-77 L2 (1985)<\/li><li>FM-77 L4 (1985)<\/li><li>FM-77 AV (1985)<\/li><li>FM-77 AV20 (1986)<\/li><li>FM-77 AV40 (1986)<\/li><li>FM-77 AV20 EX (1987)<\/li><li>FM-77 AV40 EX (1987)<\/li><li>FM-77 AV40 SX (1988)<\/li><\/ul><h2>Technical Specifications<\/h2><h3>Processors<\/h3><ul><li><b>Main CPU (Central Processing Unit) processor<\/b>: <ul><li>1982: Fujitsu MBL 68B09 (based on 8-bit Motorola 68B09) @ 4.9 - 8 MHz<\/li><li>1984: Fujitsu MBL 68B09 (based on 8-bit Motorola 68B09) @ 8 MHz<\/li><li>1985: Fujitsu MBL 68B09E (8-bit) @ 2 MHz (equivalent to MBL 68B09 @ 8 MHz)<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) processor<\/strong>: <ul><li>1982: Fujitsu MBL 68B09 (based on 8-bit Motorola 68B09) @ 2 MHz<\/li><li>1984: Fujitsu MBL 68B09E (8-bit) @ 2 MHz<\/li><li>1985: Fujitsu MMR (Memory Mapping Register), Fujitsu MBL 68B09E (8-bit) @ 2 MHz<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong>Optional CPU processor<\/strong>: Zilog Z80 (8-bit)<\/li><\/ul><h3>Memory<\/h3><ul><li><strong>Main RAM (Random Access Memory)<\/strong><ul><li>1982: 64 KB<\/li><li>1984: 64-256 KB<\/li><li>1985: 128-256 KB<\/li><li>1986: 128 KB \/ 192 KB \/ 448 KB<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong>Video RAM (VRAM) memory<\/strong>: <ul><li>1982: 48 KB<\/li><li>1985: 96 KB<\/li><li>1986: 96-144 KB<\/li><li>1987: 96-192 KB<\/li><li>1988: 192 KB<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong><b>ROM (Read-Only Memory) memory<\/b><\/strong>: 48 KB (1982), 72 KB (1985)<\/li><li><strong>Storage<\/strong>: <ul><li>Default: 10-20 MB hard disk drive (1982), 1x-2x 3.5\" DD floppy disk drives (1984)<\/li><li>Optional: Cassette tape, 5.25\" floppy disk<\/li><li>3.5\" DD (double-density) floppy disks: 320 KB each (1984), 640 KB each (1986)<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><h3>Display<\/h3><ul><li><b>Maximum display resolution<\/b>: 640x200 pixels (1982), 640x400 pixels (1984)<\/li><li><b><strong>Maximum color palette<\/strong><\/b>: 8 (1982), 16 (1984), 4096 (1985), 262,144 (1986)<\/li><li><b>Simultaneous display colors<\/b>: <ul><li>1982: 3 colors (monochrome), 8 colors (4-bit color)<\/li><li>1984: 8 colors at 640x200, 2 colors at 640x400<\/li><li>1985: 4096 colors at 320x200, 16 colors at 640x200, 2 colors at 640x400<\/li><li>1986: 4096 colors at 320x200, 16 colors at 640x200, 8 colors at 640x400<\/li><li>1987: 4096 colors at 320x200, 32 colors at 640x200, 16 colors at 640x400<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong>Monitors<\/strong>: <a href=\"\/multi-monitor-support\/3015-6433\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6433\">Multi-monitor support<\/a> for 2-6 monitors (1985)<\/li><li><strong>Video digitization<\/strong>: Supported (1985), Standard (1988)<\/li><\/ul><h3>Sound<\/h3><ul><li>1982: General Instruments AY-3-8910 sound chip (PSG synthesizer, 3 channels, 8 octaves)<\/li><li>1985: Yamaha sound board (FM synthesis, 3 channels), AY-3-8910 sound chip<\/li><\/ul><h3>Interface<\/h3><ul><li><b>Interface<\/b>: Tape, RGB, RS232, Joystick (2), ROM\/RAM cartridges, BUS<\/li><\/ul><h2>External link<\/h2><ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/museum.ipsj.or.jp\/en\/computer\/personal\/0017.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">IPSJ Computer Museum article on FM-77 AV<\/a><\/li><\/ul>",

The Game Boy was released in <a href=\"\/north-america\/3035-1664\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1664\">North America<\/a> in August, 1989, in <a href=\"\/japan\/3035-37\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan<\/a> on April 21, 1989, and in <a href=\"\/europe\/3035-289\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-289\">Europe<\/a> in September 1990. The Game Boy was the first in the Game Boy line, a line that lasted over fifteen years until the release of the <a href=\"\/nintendo-ds\/3045-52\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS<\/a>. It was created by the brilliant <a href=\"\/gunpei-yokoi\/3040-45151\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-45151\">Gunpei Yokoi<\/a>, as well as the same team that had developed Nintendo's <a href=\"\/game-watch\/3025-1183\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1183\">Game &amp; Watch<\/a> series. The Game Boy pack-in game was <a href=\"\/tetris\/3030-1896\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1896\">Tetris<\/a>, a little known puzzle game from <a href=\"\/russia\/3035-38\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-38\">Russia<\/a> that would help lead the Game Boy to its massive success. <a href=\"\/minoru-arakawa\/3040-19267\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-19267\">Minoru Arakawa<\/a> and several employees from Nintendo of America went to Russia to sign a deal to get the game on their system, they saw it as the equivalent to packing in <a href=\"\/super-mario-bros\/3030-15544\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\">Super Mario Bros<\/a> with the <a href=\"\/nes\/3045-21\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES<\/a>. Despite the Game Boy's handicap of being able to only display two colors, something that was technically inferior to what other handhelds was offering at the time it was massively more successful. Part of this was due to the fact that the batteries for Game Boy lasted a significantly longer times than those used for other full color handhelds, due to the fact that it used four AA batteries. 1998 saw Nintendo introduce the Game Boy's successor the <a href=\"\/game-boy-color\/3045-57\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-57\">Game Boy Color<\/a>; the two systems games were actually compatible with each other, with the entire Game Boy line up playable on the Game Boy Color and a select few Game Boy Color titles playable on the original Game Boy (although not in color). Backwards compatibility became a stable of Nintendo handhelds, Game Boy classic games were playable up until the release of the Nintendo DS.<\/p><p>In 1994 Nintendo released an adapter for the <a href=\"\/snes\/3045-9\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo<\/a> entitled the <a href=\"\/super-game-boy-enhancement\/3015-4804\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4804\">Super Game Boy<\/a>, which allowed Super Nintendo players to play Game Boy games on their TV with a limited amount of colors. The adapter did not require the owner to own the original Game Boy system, just the adapter; despite this Game Boy remained as popular as ever. The first variation of the Game Boy, the Game Boy Pocket arrived in 1996. It was slimmer, more compact and the first in what would become a Nintendo tradition of releasing multiple variations of their handhelds. The Game Boy managed to sell its shipment of a million units within weeks in the <a href=\"\/the-united-states-of-america\/3035-396\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">United States<\/a> and its initial shipment of 300,000 units in Japan in two weeks and reached 500,000 sales in Japan by July. The Game Boy and the color has sold 118.69 million combined worldwide and the Game Boy had sold 66.42 million alone before the release of the color. Twenty years after its introduction, in 2009 the Game Boy was inducted into the Nintendo toy hall of fame.<\/p><h2>Competition<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/130768\/1859791-nintendoad29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1859791\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:130.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/130768\/1859791-nintendoad29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1859791\"><img alt=\"An ad for the Atari Lynx that portrays the Gameboy as underpowered.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/130768\/1859791-nintendoad29.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/130768\/1859791-nintendoad29.jpg 800w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/130768\/1859791-nintendoad29.jpg 738w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/130768\/1859791-nintendoad29.jpg 492w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\" data-width=\"492\"><\/a><figcaption>An ad for the Atari Lynx that portrays the Gameboy as underpowered.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>When it launched in 1989, the Game Boy entered a handheld battle against the <a href=\"\/lynx\/3045-7\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-7\">Atari Lynx<\/a> and <a href=\"\/game-gear\/3045-5\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-5\">Sega Game Gear<\/a>. Both the Lynx and Game Gear were technologically impressive for the time. They featured full color backlit screens and, in the case of the Lynx, significantly more processing power. Atari and Sega attempted to capitalize on their products' capabilites in advertisements that portrayed the Game Boy as weak and childish. A memorable Sega ad from the time proclaimed that \"The Sega Game Gear separates the men from the boys\". Despite their marketing efforts, the Lynx and Game Gear could not stop the Game Boy's dominance. Their weak battery life (a Game Gear or Lynx could deplete six AA batteries in 4-6 hours), combined with lackluster software libraries and higher prices, proved fatal. <\/p><h2>Hardware Revisions<\/h2><p>There was three different versions of the Game Boy that was released during its life.

The classic Game Boy ran on 4 AA batteries which powered the system for around 35 hours. Despite its size and less than perfect monochromatic screen the Game Boy lasted seven years until it received its first update. The Game Boy was only available in grey, in 1995 a \"Play it Loud\" line of the handheld was available in red, green, black, yellow, blue, white and transparent though this line had the exact same specifications. This set a trend of Nintendo handheld's being released in multiple colours. The link cable port is larger than the rest of the Game Boy line which makes it unable to link with all future models of the Game Boy.<\/p><p>RAM: 8 kB internal S-RAM<\/p><ul><li>Video RAM: 8 kB internal<\/li><li>ROM: 8 Mb cartridges<\/li><li>Sound: 2 Square Waves, 1 programmable 32-sample 4-bit PCM Wave, 1 White noise, and one audio input from the cartridge.<\/li><li>Display: Reflective LCD 160 x 144 pixels<\/li><li>Screen Size: 66 mm (2.6 in) diagonal<\/li><li>Power: 4 AA Batteries<\/li><li>Dimensions: 148 x 89 x 32 mm<\/li><li>Weight: 394g (with batteries)<\/li><\/ul><h3>Game Boy Pocket<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1777455\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1777455\"><img alt=\"Game Boy Pocket\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/112517\/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/112517\/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/112517\/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/112517\/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/112517\/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Game Boy Pocket\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/112517\/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/112517\/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/112517\/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/112517\/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/112517\/1777455-gameboy_pocket.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Game Boy Pocket<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Game Boy Pocket was originally released July 21, 1996 in Japan and then later released in North America in September 3, 1996. The Game Boy Pocket was smaller, lighter version of the original Game Boy designed to be able to easily fit in your pocket. An additional plus point of the system was that it only needed 2 AAA batteries, though this only powered the system for 10 hours. The Pocket featured a re-designed smaller link port, this version of the port was later used for all later models in the Game Boy line. Another improvement was an improved monochrome screen which did not blur up like on the original. The Game Boy Pocket like the original had no blacklight for darkened area and the first run did not feature a LED to indicate power levels, though due to public outcry a LED was added. The Pocket has been released in silver\/chrome, red, yellow, green, black, transparent, pink and the original grey. Some limited editions of the handheld were also released.<\/p><ul><li>CPU: Custom 8-bit Sharp LR35902 core at 4.19 MHz<\/li><li>RAM: 8 kB internal S-RAM<\/li><li>Video RAM: 8 kB internal<\/li><li>ROM: 8 Mb cartridges<\/li><li>Sound: 2 Square Waves, 1 programmable 32-sample 4-bit PCM Wave, 1 White noise, and one audio input from the cartridge.<\/li><li>Display: Reflective LCD 160 x 144 pixels<\/li><li>Screen Size: 66 mm (2.6 in) diagonal<\/li><li>Power Supply: 2 AAA Batteries<\/li><li>Dimensions: 124 x 76 x 23 mm<\/li><li>Weight: 148g (with batteries)<\/li><\/ul><h3>Game Boy Light<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1777456-gbl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1777456\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.99277456647399\" data-width=\"692\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 692px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:99.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1777456-gbl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1777456\"><img alt=\"Game Boy Light\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/112517\/1777456-gbl.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/112517\/1777456-gbl.jpg 692w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/112517\/1777456-gbl.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/112517\/1777456-gbl.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Game Boy Light\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/112517\/1777456-gbl.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/112517\/1777456-gbl.jpg 692w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/112517\/1777456-gbl.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/112517\/1777456-gbl.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Game Boy Light<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Game Boy Light was a Japan exclusive variation of the handheld that was released on April 14, 1998, due to its Japan only release it is one of the rarest Game Boy models.

In September of 2005, a back-lit model of the SP was released. This version of the hardware is recognizable by the model number AGS-101.<\/td><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8272\/1352103-gbasp_famicom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1352103\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0933333333333\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:109.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8272\/1352103-gbasp_famicom.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1352103\"><img alt=\"Famicom version\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8272\/1352103-gbasp_famicom.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8272\/1352103-gbasp_famicom.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Famicom version\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8272\/1352103-gbasp_famicom.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8272\/1352103-gbasp_famicom.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Famicom version<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><h3>Hardware Specs<\/h3><ul><li>CPU: 32-bit RISC-CPU with embedded memory<\/li><li>Screen: 2.9\" Reflective TFT Color LCD Display Size: 1.61\" x 2.41\"<\/li><li>Resolution: 240 x 160 pixels Color:<\/li><li>Simultaneously display more than 32,000 colors<\/li><li>Size (Closed): Height 3.33 inches, width 3.23 inches, depth 0.96 inches<\/li><li>Weight: Approximately 5 ounces (140 grams)<\/li><li>Power Supply: Lithium-Ion rechargeable battery<\/li><li>Battery Life: Approximately 10 hours of continuous play with light, 18 hours without light<\/li><\/ul><\/td><td><ul><li>Launch Date: March 23, 2003<\/li><li>Launch Price: $ 99.99<\/li><\/ul><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><table><tbody><tr><th>Game Boy Micro<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Tiny in size, the third design borrowed from the then-popular cell phone trend of having interchangeable face-plates.

It was released on November 19, 1998 in North America, on October 21, 1998 in Japan, on November 23, 1998 in Europe, and in 1999 in Australia. Unlike its predecessor, it featured a color screen. It was smaller than the original Game Boy, but slightly larger than the Game Boy Pocket. The Game Boy Color only used 2 AA batteries as compared to the originals 4, and the Game Boy Pocket's 2 AAA's. Combined sales of the Game Boy and Game Boy Color were charted at 118.69 million worldwide. Total Sales for Japan reached 32.47 million units, 44.06 million in the the Americas, and 2.16 million in other regions.<\/p><p>The Game Boy Color was originally a response by Nintendo from the pressure of developers for new and more sophisticated hardware. Developers felt that the Game Boy, and even the recently released Game Boy Pocket, were far too simple and stifled creative ability. To combat this, Nintendo released the Game Boy Color. The Game Boy Color was the first handheld video game console to be <a href=\"\/backwards-compatibility\/3015-1053\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1053\">backwards compatible<\/a>, meaning that original Game Boy games could be played on it. This has since become a standard in the Game Boy line. The Color boasted a processor twice as powerful as its predecessor, as well as four times the available system memory. This allowed for developers to create much larger and longer games than possible with the original systems specifications.<\/p><h3>Cartridge Types<\/h3><p>Many games released during the Game Boy Color's run were developed to be still be compatible with the older Game Boy classic and Game Boy Pocket. Cartridges that were backwards-compatible with the older hardware kept the traditional Game Boy cartridge shape, but were colored black instead of the traditional gray. Games exclusive to the Color, however, were released in a clear cartridge with a bulging extraction grip, as opposed to the traditional indented one.<\/p><h2>Launch Titles<\/h2><h3>Japan<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"\/dragon-warrior-monsters\/3030-13470\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13470\">Dragon Warrior Monsters<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/hexcite-the-shapes-of-victory\/3030-871\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-871\">Hexcite<\/a><\/li><li>Pocket Bowling<\/li><li><a href=\"\/tetris-dx\/3030-796\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-796\">Tetris DX<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/wario-land-ii\/3030-13721\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13721\">Wario Land II<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h3>North America<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"\/centipede\/3030-1157\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1157\">Centipede<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/game-watch-gallery-2\/3030-9957\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9957\">Game &amp; Watch Gallery 2<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/pocket-bomberman\/3030-23456\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23456\">Pocket Bomberman<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/tetris-dx\/3030-796\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-796\">Tetris DX<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h3>Europe<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"\/tetris-dx\/3030-796\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-796\">Tetris DX<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/game-watch-gallery-2\/3030-9957\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9957\">Game and Watch Gallery 2<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/centipede\/3030-1157\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1157\">Centipede<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/pocket-bomberman\/3030-23456\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23456\">Pocket Bomberman<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h2>Hardware Specifications<\/h2><ul><li>Processor - Similar to the Z80, manufactured by Sharp with some bit manipulation<\/li><li>Clock Speed - 8 MHz<\/li><li>Memory - 32 kilobytes of system RAM, 16 kilobytes of video RAM<\/li><li>Screen Resolution - 160x144 pixels<\/li><li>Colors - 56 simultaneously onscreen from a palette of 32,768 colors<\/li><\/ul><h3>Colors<\/h3><p>Several different colors of the system was produced, many being limited or special editions.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/813166-10351_gbc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-813166\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.6764705882353\" data-width=\"238\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 238px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:167.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/813166-10351_gbc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-813166\"><img alt=\"Pok\u00e9mon edition\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/813166-10351_gbc.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/813166-10351_gbc.jpg 238w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px\" data-width=\"238\"><\/a><figcaption>Pok\u00e9mon edition<\/figcaption><\/figure><ul><li>Berry<\/li><li>Grape<\/li><li>Kiwi<\/li><li>Dandelion<\/li><li>Teal<\/li><li>Atomic Purple<\/li><li><a href=\"\/pokemon-goldsilver\/3030-8210\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8210\">Pok\u00e9mon Gold\/Silver<\/a> edition<\/li><li><a href=\"\/pokemon\/3025-452\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-452\">Pok\u00e9mon<\/a> edition<\/li><li>Pok\u00e9mon Center edition<\/li><li><a href=\"\/hello-kitty\/3025-1151\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1151\">Hello Kitty<\/a> edition (Japan only)<\/li><li>Clear (Japan only)<\/li><li>Clear black<\/li><li>Clear green (Japan only)<\/li><li>Midnight blue<\/li><li>Ice blue<\/li><li>Clear orange (Japan only)<\/li><li>Clear blue<\/li><li>Tommy Hilfiger Edition<\/li><\/ul><h2>Games<\/h2><p>The Game Boy Color featured an extremely robust library.

            "description": "<h2>Overview<\/h2><p><a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\"> Sega<\/a> Game Gear came out in the U.S. in 1991. Work originally began on the console in 1989 under the codename \"Project Mercury\", following Sega's policy at the time of codenaming their systems after planets. Like the <a href=\"\/sega-master-system\/3045-8\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-8\"> Sega Master System<\/a>, it was an <a href=\"\/8-bit\/3015-5951\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5951\"> 8-bit<\/a> system. It was only the third commercially available color handheld console, after the <a href=\"\/lynx\/3045-7\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-7\"> Atari Lynx<\/a> and the TurboExpress. .It could run on 6-AA batteries or an AC adapter could be used to plug the GG into the wall or outlet. It came packaged with <em><a href=\"\/columns\/3030-5487\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5487\"> <i>Columns<\/i><\/a><\/em> a \"<a href=\"\/tetris\/3030-1896\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1896\"> Tetris<\/a> type\" game, in which you have to match the colored blocks as opposed to making lines.<\/p><p>The GG had many accessories. One of them was a TV tuner, which no longer works as of February 2000. Rechargable battery packs to help make the GG portable and not make you keep buying AA batteries every 2 hours, master gear converter to play Master System cartridges on the GG, a car adapter for playing in the car without batteries, and much more.<\/p><p>Originally only available in black, the GG was available in other colors. A Japan only release of an ultra-limited (10,000 units) white console in a special metal game case and TV Tuner was available soon after launch. Later a special blue sports themed version and a Coca-cola Red version were available in the US.<\/p><p>The Game Gear was built as a \"landscape\" hand-held. This meant that the D-pad and buttons were to the sides of the screen as opposed to being at the bottom like the <a href=\"\/game-boy\/3045-3\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\"> Game Boy<\/a>. This made the GG a lot more comfortable to hold because you hands were not so close and crammed together. The Game Gear ultimately played second fiddle to the Game Boy and despite being more popular in Europe it still became the first Sega product to be beaten in sales by a competing <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\"> Nintendo<\/a> product in the region.<\/p><h2>Launch<\/h2><h3>Japan - October 6, 1990<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"\/columns\/3030-5487\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5487\"> Columns<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/pengo\/3030-4196\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4196\"> Pengo<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/super-monaco-gp\/3030-532\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-532\"> Super Monaco GP<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h3>North America - April 26, 1991<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"\/castle-of-illusion-starring-mickey-mouse\/3030-9513\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9513\"> Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/columns\/3030-5487\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5487\"> Columns<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/g-loc-air-battle\/3030-13742\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13742\"> G-Loc<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/psychic-world\/3030-10932\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10932\"> Psychic World<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/wonder-boy\/3030-5220\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5220\"> Revenge of Drancon<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/super-monaco-gp\/3030-532\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-532\"> Super Monaco GP<\/a><\/li><\/ul>",

They released cartridge based <a href=\"\/r-zone\/3045-103\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-103\">R-Zone<\/a> in 1995, but it was short-lived, as the <a href=\"\/game-boy\/3045-3\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy<\/a> dominated the handheld market, and Tiger's simpler titles were less appealing to gamers. In an attempt to compete directly with the Game Boy, Tiger released the Game.com in 1997 with a puzzle title, <a href=\"\/lights-out\/3030-22805\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22805\">Lights Out<\/a>, as the pack-in game. IP license agreements secured for the portable LCD games remained in effect, which Tiger expected to fully leverage on the Game.com. Popular console titles such as <a href=\"\/mortal-kombat-trilogy\/3030-8279\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8279\">Mortal Kombat Trilogy<\/a>, <a href=\"\/williams-arcade-classics\/3030-1956\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1956\">Williams Arcade Classics<\/a>, <a href=\"\/sonic-jam\/3030-2391\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2391\">Sonic Jam<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/fighters-megamix\/3030-19043\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19043\">Fighters Megamix<\/a> were released either at launch or shortly after alongside adaptations of popular Tiger handheld products including Henry and Quiz Wiz, plus a promotional booklet teased ports of <a href=\"\/road-rash\/3030-8251\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8251\">Road Rash<\/a>, <a href=\"\/ea-sports\/3010-6255\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6255\">EA Sports<\/a> titles and games based on upcoming films such as <a href=\"\/batman-robin\/3030-13568\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13568\">Batman &amp; Robin<\/a> and <a href=\"\/the-lost-world-jurassic-park\/3030-4125\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4125\">The Lost World: Jurrasic Park <\/a>(few of which were actually released).<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Additionally, the Game.com was to be the first handheld system to feature internet connectivity. This was, in fact, the handheld's main selling point. Internet connectivity would prove difficult, however, as access required a phone cord and jack, as well as a bulky external modem. Users were required to use Tiger's own ISP to get online with the devices. Like most WAP-enabled devices of the day, the Game.com was equipped with a text-based web browser that allowed users to access online scoreboards and other WAP and Game.com specific content. Users could also check their email through the service, but due to the high cost of getting the Game.com online, adoption rates for the console's online services were low.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Later in the console's lifespan, Tiger released a new, smaller version called the Game.com Pocket Pro. It features a smaller screen, one cartridge port, a lit screen (in the first few production runs), and eliminated the console's online functionality. New games, including ports of <a href=\"\/resident-evil-2\/3030-9418\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9418\">Resident Evil 2<\/a> and the modernized versions of <a href=\"\/centipede\/3030-25567\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25567\">Centipede<\/a> and <a href=\"\/frogger-3d\/3030-24704\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24704\">Frogger<\/a>, were released alongside the console. In 2000, when both the original Game.com and the Pocket Pro failed in the marketplace, Tiger pulled support, leaving games such as <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid\/3030-16140\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16140\">Metal Gear Solid<\/a>, <a href=\"\/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night\/3030-14216\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14216\">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night<\/a>, Giga Pets, and <a href=\"\/george-foremans-ko-boxing\/3030-13997\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13997\">Foreman Boxing<\/a> (supposedly with force feedback capabilities) unfinished.<\/p><h2>Legacy<\/h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While the console was a commercial failure, internet capabilities in handheld gaming devices became a popular feature in later handheld consoles. The console also featured a touch screen before the <a href=\"\/nintendo-ds\/3045-52\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS<\/a> made touch-screen gaming popular in the handheld market. The console's failure caused Tiger to leave the gaming market and focus on developing consumer electronics aimed at children.<\/p><h2>Emulation<\/h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In 2005, an online group referring to themselves as the \"game.commies\" announced they would be working on hacking the game.com platform to enable emulation. An emulator was released in 2011. <\/p>",

A voice would then whisper, \"GameCube.\" This was usually shown at the end of a commercial for a GameCube game.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1844595-download.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1844595\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1844595-download.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1844595\"><img alt=\"A wallpaper for the \"Who Are You?\" campaign.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1844595-download.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1844595-download.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/7465\/1844595-download.jpeg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/7465\/1844595-download.jpeg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1844595-download.jpeg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A wallpaper for the \"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A wallpaper for the \"Who Are You?\" campaign.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Another well known advertising campaign was the \"Who Are You?\" advertising campaign. This was used to market a wide variety of Nintendo games. The \"Who Are You?\" logo was graffiti lettering. Most of the commercials and print ads were games developed or published by Nintendo, but some third-party developers were able to use the campaign as well. The idea behind the campaign was that players were the character that they played, with print ads showing pieces of the main character taped onto a photograph of a person (e.g. the helmet of Samus Aran taped onto a ballerina to promote Metroid Prime).<\/p><p>There was a distinct difference in the way Nintendo of Japan marketed the GameCube and how it was marketed in western markets. Although in western markets, the GameCube was advertised as a console for experienced gamers; in Japan, it was marketed to appeal to younger and newer players, as a way of gaining back the child audience they lost to their competitors in the previous console cycle. However, it failed, and the GameCube was a commercial flop in Japan. However, due to being marketed to a different audience outside Japan, the GameCube became a very successful console in other countries.<\/p><h2>Hardware<\/h2><p>Due to pressures from developers, the GameCube was <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo<\/a>'s first console to introduce a disc medium instead of cartridges, the games were recorded on mini DVDs.

It allowed players to play from up to 20 feet away. It had the same button layout than the original controller except for an on and off button and a bulkier feel. The controller came with a wireless receiver. To play, the player had to tune his controller to one of the 16 radio channels that the little wheel at the bottom of the controller offered. Then, he had to put the same channel number on the receiver, plug the receiver into the GameCube's controller socket, turn on his controller and a light on the receiver would tell the player that it was receiving a signal.

            "description": "<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>Originally released on November 23, 2001, the GamePark 32 is a Korean handheld console developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-7530\" href=\"\/gamepark\/3010-7530\/\" slug=\"gamepark\">GamePark<\/a>. The console was released mostly in Korea, although it can be found in other countries where official distributors are located, such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. The GamePark 32 never saw a release in North America.<\/p><p>The GamePark 32 is quite unlike other handheld consoles of the time. Instead of using a proprietary form of media to play games, the GamePark 32 uses SmartMedia cards, which makes the console very accessible from a development standpoint. Additionally, the console has a USB (Universal Serial Bus) port for external peripherals, such as a keyboard.<\/p><h2>Capabilities<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1845241-473043gp32.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1845241\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.612\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1845241-473043gp32.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1845241\"><img alt=\"Games could be downloaded or purchased at a retailer.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1845241-473043gp32.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/1845241-473043gp32.jpg 500w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/7465\/1845241-473043gp32.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/1845241-473043gp32.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Games could be downloaded or purchased at a retailer.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The GamePark 32, new out of the box, was capable of doing a few things already. It could launch applications either from a SmartMedia card of downloaded from an online store, it could play MP3 format music files, and it could connect to personal computers. Applications could be purchased or downloaded in several ways. Most commercial games were available boxed in retail stores, as well as the online \"JoyGP\" store. JoyGP was the international version of MegaGP, a Korean online store meant for downloading games. Games downloaded from the JoyGP online store were typically sold at a reduced price from their boxed counterparts (typically from $10USD to $30USD).<\/p><p>Homebrew software initially required the end user to download GamePark's \"Free Launcher\" to run, but later firmware rendered that not necessary. The GamePark's C-based code made it easy for application developers to create homebrew software for the GamePark 32, so many such applications were released. Some of these include various emulators (for a variety of consoles), a DivX player, file managers, homebrew games, and more.<\/p><h2>Launch Titles<\/h2><p>Upon the GamePark's initial release, there were five titles also available.

The BLU+ is the only variant of the GamePark 32 that is incompatible with some software, due to the fact that it has a different LCD screen.<\/p>",

Both CPU chips were commonly used together in Sega<a href=\"\/arcade\/3045-84\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\"> arcade<\/a> cabinets at the time--as well as arcade cabinets in general during the late 80s and early 90s. Sega's goal was to give home consumers a taste of arcade quality gameplay, made popular by their System-16 arcade cabinets, where hit games like <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/golden-axe\/3030-14351\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14351\">Golden Axe<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/altered-beast\/3030-2536\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2536\">Altered Beast<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/alien-syndrome\/3030-22009\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22009\">Alien Syndrome <\/a>were frequently played in the arcades. An image from the video game Altered Beast was even used as the console box art, to help market it as a 16-bit arcade console. The console was not as powerful as their System-16 and future 16-bit arcade cabinets, however. The console used a 9-bit color palette, compared to a 16-bit color palette used in their early 16-bit arcade cabinets. The console could only display 80 sprites on screen, compared to the 128 sprites from their System 16 cabinets. Sega also used a lower grade version of the sound chips used in most arcade cabinets at the time. The basic structure, however, allowed for many good (but not perfect) arcade ports of their games, as well as games from other developers.<\/p><p>It had a production run lasting from 1988, when it was first released in Japan, to 1997, when it was finally discontinued.

Many later Genesis games recommended the use of this secondary controller (many of them fighting games), as games that were played with the original controller and designed for the new six-button one would need to tap the start button to switch the three face buttons to the function of the other three.<\/p><h2>Accessories<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/139866\/2720463-4113433581-XE1AP.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2720463\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/139866\/2720463-4113433581-XE1AP.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2720463\"><img alt=\"XE-1AP Controller\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/139866\/2720463-4113433581-XE1AP.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/139866\/2720463-4113433581-XE1AP.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/139866\/2720463-4113433581-XE1AP.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/139866\/2720463-4113433581-XE1AP.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"XE-1AP Controller\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/139866\/2720463-4113433581-XE1AP.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/139866\/2720463-4113433581-XE1AP.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/139866\/2720463-4113433581-XE1AP.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/139866\/2720463-4113433581-XE1AP.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>XE-1AP Controller<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Sega Mega Drive\/Genesis supported the following accessories:<\/p><ul><li><strong><a href=\"\/x-e-1-a-p\/3000-80\/\" data-ref-id=\"3000-80\">XE-1AP<\/a><\/strong>, released by <a href=\"\/dempa-micomsoft\/3010-4743\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-4743\">Dempa Micomsoft<\/a> only for Japan in 1989.

The Sega Channel was a hardware add-on meant to be placed on top of the Genesis cartridge slot. The add-on allowed players to download games directly to their Sega Genesis consoles and play the games for a monthly fee. They did this by connecting a coaxial cable (the same kind used on cable boxes) to the back of the cartridge add-on. One could then choose to browse games from a variety of menus. Categories like shooter, role playing, platforming, etc. contained many popular Genesis titles people could download and play. After 30 days the games available would change. Usually, the most popular games were kept in service while the games people hardly played were replaced with other games. The Sega Channel also kept track of new games that were released. The games were usually available a month after their official release dates. Japanese import games were also available to subscribers. The activation fee was $29.95, and the monthly fee was $14.95. The service lasted until 1998, when the 32-bit era was established with the Sega Saturn, and the <a href=\"..\/..\/playstation\/60-22\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sony PlayStation<\/a>.

Released in October of 1995 at a price of $180 USD, the Nomad featured a 3.25 inch color screen and ran on six AA batteries.<\/p><p>Interestingly, the Nomad was a fully functional Genesis home console in addition to being a handheld device. Television connectivity was provided through an A\/V slot on top of the unit. For single player games, the Nomad itself functioned as the controller, but two player gaming was possible using a controller port on the bottom of the device. This port accepted standard Genesis controllers.<\/p><p>The Nomad suffered from problems that plagued Sega's other handheld, the 8-bit <a href=\"\/game-gear\/3045-5\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-5\">Game Gear<\/a>. Both machines were notoriously power-hungry thanks to their (relatively) powerful processors and high quality backlit LCD screens. The Nomad was capable of depleting its batteries in two hours, which lessened its appeal as a portable device. Additionally, despite being advertised as a wholly-capable Genesis console, the Nomad was functionally incompatible with the various Genesis add-ons Sega had released such as the <a href=\"\/sega-cd\/3045-29\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-29\">Sega CD<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sega-32x\/3045-31\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-31\">32X<\/a>. These compatibility problems were due to the shape of the Nomad, and the inability to mount these accessories on its portable form factor.<\/p><p>Faced with competition from Nintendo's hugely successful Game Boy, the Nomad faltered at market. By the time Sega ceased production, it had only managed to sell 1 million units.<\/p><h2>PC\/Mega Drive Hybrids<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/12063\/2902949-1704098014-amstr.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2902949\" data-ratio=\"0.8975\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/12063\/2902949-1704098014-amstr.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2902949\"><img alt=\"The Amstrad Mega PC. \"Brilliant for Business, Mega for Games!\"\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/12063\/2902949-1704098014-amstr.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/12063\/2902949-1704098014-amstr.jpg 400w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/12063\/2902949-1704098014-amstr.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Amstrad Mega PC. \"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Amstrad Mega PC. \"Brilliant for Business, Mega for Games!\"<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In an effort to sell the Genesis hardware to a wider audience, two different PC and Mega Drive hybrid computers were created: the <em>TeraDrive<\/em> in Japan (manufactured by IBM), and the <em>Mega PC<\/em>in Europe (manufactured by Amstrad).<\/p><p>While the Mega PC was an isolated ISA card that could only be used when the PC was inactive, the TeraDrive hardware allowed PC software and Mega Drive games to interact with each other.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, both the TeraDrive and the Mega PC were hampered by low spec PC hardware (286 and 386SX respectively) that had to compete against 486 and Pentium-based PCs.<\/p><p> <\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Launch Titles<\/h2><h3>United States<\/h3><p>The Sega Genesis launched along with the following 7 games in the US August 14th 1989.<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"..\/..\/space-harrier-ii\/61-12420\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Space Harrier II<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/thunder-force-ii\/61-12471\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thunder Force II<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/tommy-lasorda-baseball\/61-11264\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tommy Lasorda Baseball<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/last-battle\/61-12187\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Last Battle<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/altered-beast\/61-2536\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Altered Beast<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/alex-kidd-in-the-enchanted-castle\/61-4968\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alex Kidd in The Enchanted Castle<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"..\/..\/ghouls-n-ghosts\/61-12381\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ghouls n' Ghosts<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h2>Hardware Specifications<\/h2><h3>CPU (Central Processing Unit)<\/h3><ul><li>Main Processor Unit: Motorola 68000 at 7.67 MHz<\/li><li>Secondary Processor Unit: Zilog Z80 at 3.58 MHz<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>Note: <\/strong>The Zilog Z80 is used to control the sound chip.<\/p><h3>Graphics<\/h3><ul><li>Maximum Color Palette: 512 (9-bit color)<br \/><ul><li>64 colors on screen at once<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Maximum Sprites On Screen: 80<\/li><li>Screen Resolution: 256 x 192 - 320 x 448<\/li><li>Possible AV Outputs <ul><li>RF (Radio Frequency Unit with Coaxial Cable)<\/li><li>Composite (RCA Cable)<\/li><li>S-Video (Separate Video Cable for Model 3 and Custom Units),<\/li><li>Component (RGB Cable)<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><h3>Sound<\/h3><ul><li>Yamaha 2612 Sound Chip <ul><li>6 Channel FM (Frequency Modulation) at 7.67 MHz<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Texas Instrument Programmable Sound Generator (version Ti-SN76489) <ul><li>4 Channels at 3.58 MHz<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Sample Rate 22 KHz<\/li><\/ul><p><b>Note:<\/b> The sixth FM channel on the YM-2612 can be used as a 8-bit PCM.

            "description": "<h2>History<\/h2><p>Originally announced as the Gametrac, before being renamed after <a href=\"\/gametrak-dark-wind\/3030-7514\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7514\">Gametrak<\/a> discovered the name and complained that the name breached their copyright, the Gizmondo was a multi-function handheld games device launched by a UK subsidiary of US-based Tiger Telematics in 2005. The device was intended to compete against <a href=\"\/sony-computer-entertainment-incorporated\/3010-995\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-995\">Sony's<\/a> <a href=\"\/psp\/3045-18\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP<\/a> and <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo's<\/a> <a href=\"\/nintendo-ds\/3045-52\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">DS<\/a> but due to a limited release which initially only included the <a href=\"\/united-kingdom\/3035-492\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-492\">UK<\/a> (And only select retailers at that) and later limited availability in the <a href=\"\/the-united-states-of-america\/3035-396\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">USA<\/a>, the console floundered.<\/p><p>The initial release of the console saw only two games, <a href=\"\/fathammer-classics-pack\/3030-18384\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18384\">Fathammer Classics Pack<\/a> (A collection of 3 games from the <a href=\"\/fathammer-ltd\/3010-2877\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2877\">Fathammer<\/a> games line) and <a href=\"\/trailblazer\/3030-6711\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6711\">Trailblazer<\/a>. The latter game was more popular with users and throughout the life of the platform was one of if not the most popular game in the community. Gizmondo promised to bring more games including some which made use of the console's unique features (<a href=\"\/colors\/3030-22561\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22561\">Colors<\/a> promised GPS-powered \"Turf Wars\" where players could fight for control of real-life areas, Agaju promised to use the camera for FPS controls and other augmented reality features), however only 14 games ever made it to release - and none which made use of the platform's unique features.<\/p><p>The console was released in the US exclusively through specific Gizmondo mall kiosks. Shortly after the US release, it was discovered that at least one of the big names (<a href=\"\/stefan-eriksson\/3040-89957\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89957\">Stefan Eriksson<\/a>) behind the company and, by extension, the platform, were members of the Uppsalamaffian, a Swedish mafia. The company never recovered and at any rate had incurred massive losses. To make matters worse, the company began circulating images of an improved Gizmondo before the console even went on sale in the US. The Gizmondo WS (WideScreen) strongly resembled the PSP and its existence angered existing owners (In the UK) because they felt they had bought the wrong machine and were going to be left out in the cold. American buyers were promised \"an upgrade path\" to the new system, but what this was was never made clear. No such option was ever said to be available to UK customers.<\/p><p>At any rate, the console never emerged and likely never got beyond the concept stage. The company essentially \"went dark\" shortly after the US launch due to lack of funds and the company finally went into bankruptcy in February of 2006.<\/p><p>Since then, the console has been cracked and the community, lead by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gizmondoforums.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">GizmondoForums.com<\/a>, have spent much time porting games, finding and releasing the console's lost commercial games (Chicane: Jenson Button Street Racing, <a href=\"\/sonic-the-hedgehog\/3030-2465\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2465\">Sonic the Hedgehog<\/a>, Colors, <a href=\"\/carmageddon\/3030-18394\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18394\">Carmageddon<\/a> and more) and creating all-new games and applications as homebrew efforts.<\/p><p>Some individuals think that the system failed because of its lack of games. With a catalogue of games like <a href=\"\/alien-hominid\/3030-17452\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17452\">Alien Hominid<\/a> and <a href=\"\/ssx-3\/3030-17149\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17149\">SSX 3<\/a>, the Gizmondo just couldn't compete with cheaper handheld systems like the Nintendo DS.<\/p><p>In 2008, Carl Freer (Gizmondo's Chairman and the platform's corporate champion) announced he had reached an agreement with the liquidators and planned to re-launch the Gizmondo brand with a new console. This eventually came to nothing. The planned new console had been based on the existing hardware, but running open source software.<\/p><h2>The Hardware<\/h2><p>The Gizmondo was essentially a WindowsCE .net HandheldPC, using the embedded OS to run a custom GUI. It sported a 400MHz ARM9 processor, a 2.8\" 320x480 TFT screen and an <a href=\"\/nvidia-corporation\/3010-6345\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6345\">nVidia<\/a> GoForce 3D 4500 GPU (The GPU initially delayed the launch as the developers decided to change from a 2D chip to a 3D to better compete with the specs of the DS and PSP). Other hardware features included a 0.3 Megapixel camera, GPS for navigation &amp; (In select - canceled - games) location-based gameplay and a tri-band GSM radio which was used to supply an internet connection for e-mails and to send and receive SMS\/MMS messages. It was also intended to be used for certain aspects of multiplayer, though this largely failed to materialise. Note that whilst it had a SIM Card and a phone number, the console did not support voice calling or any kind of voice communication.<\/p><p>Additionally, the system featured a Bluetooth radio, primarily used for multiplayer gaming. Other I\/O included a standard 3.5mm headphone jack (The console also shipped with re-branded Sennheiser earphones), miniUSB and an SD card slot which served as the primary storage for games, movies and music. The system, like those it competed with, used a rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery (Which was notably temperamental, sometimes only providing an hour's use off of a full charge if users did not charge it in regular charge, drain, charge cycles).<\/p><p>The battery was replaced in the US with a larger version to improve battery life. This necessitated a larger battery door, meaning US Gizmondos do not follow the same curvature as UK models - there is a large rectangular bulge. This new battery door also allowed the attaching of a wrist strap (Which was bundled) though. This model was never offered in the UK.<\/p><h2>Smart Adds<\/h2><p>After the initial launch, users could receive a discount on Gizmondo hardware if they agreed to receive targeted, location-based advertising. This was also offered to existing users who received a voucher and accessories gift pack for signing up in lieu of the discount. Despite a system update which added a \"Smart Adds\" option to the menu, no ads were ever distributed through the service - which meant everyone who had signed up for the service got either a discount or their gift pack for absolutely nothing. Some people think even the thought of this was partially why the system failed.<\/p>",

It is the first and only console to use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. The console reads UDF-format CDs that contain a proprietary executable file with the game file. The idea of the HyperScan was to combine card collecting with video gaming and target an audience of younger children who are not ready for mainstream consoles. When scanned, cards will activate characters or power them up for the game currently being played. Only five games were released for the HyperScan out of seven announced, and the system was discontinued by Mattel in 2008.<\/p><h2>Hardware<\/h2><p>The HyperScan's main feature is an RFID scanner that reads cards and writes data back to them. It retailed for $69.99, with extra controllers for $19.99. The system has a 4x CD-ROM drive and only supports composite video. The 162MHz Sunplus nMedia processor is not very powerful, and the console only has a 2D graphics engine, so none of the five games released have any 3D graphics. The graphics are frowned upon for being excessively choppy and sluggish, and the load times off of the CD-Rom drive are upwards of 20 seconds in games. The system supports up to two players. Each controller is a simple faux analog stick with 4 buttons which was not ergonomically designed at all. The video in the games is compressed using MPEG4, and the audio using MP3.<\/p><h3>Technical Specifications<\/h3><p><em>CPU<\/em> - SCore (162 MHz Sunplus mMedia 32-bit RISC processor)<\/p><p><em>Video<\/em> - Composite, 2D graphic engine, 640x480 resolution, MPEG4 codec<\/p><p><em>Audio<\/em> - MP3 codec, 24 PCM sound channels<\/p><p><em>Memory<\/em> - 16 MB SDRAM<\/p><p><em>ODD <\/em>- 4x CD-Rom drive <u><\/u><em>IO<\/em> - 1x USB 1.1 port, RFID Scanner<\/p><p><em>RFID Scanner<\/em> - 13.56 MHz<\/p><p><em>RFID Storage<\/em> - 110 bytes (96 bytes of user memory 8 bytes unique ID 6 bytes of one time programmable memory)<\/p><h2>Software<\/h2><p>The HyperScan had seven titles planned, but only five were ever released. Games were mostly 2D fighters and platformers. An <a href=\"\/x-men\/3030-24897\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24897\"> X-Men<\/a> 2D fighting game was included with the console.

Each game required cards to work, which were to be purchased separately for $14.99 per booster pack of 6 cards.

            "deck": "The Intellivision by Mattel Electronics was a system known for its unique controllers and cutting-edge graphics in the early 1980s, but it was ultimately overshadowed by the technically less powerful, Atari 2600.",
            "description": "<h2 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Overview<\/h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Intellivision was created by <a href=\"\/mattel-electronics\/3010-460\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-460\">Mattel Electronics <\/a>and released nationwide in 1980, with <a href=\"\/las-vegas-poker-blackjack\/3030-1411\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1411\"><i>Las Vegas <\/i>Poker &amp; Blackjack <\/a>as the pack-in game. In late 1982, the pack-in was changed to<a href=\"\/astrosmash\/3030-8125\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8125\"> Astrosmash<\/a>. Most of the marketing campaign focused on comparing the Intellivision to the <a href=\"\/atari-2600\/3045-40\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-40\">Atari 2600<\/a>, demonstrating the Intellivision's graphical and technological superiority.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The console had its cartridge slot on the right side of the system, and the top was utilized for controller storage. The controllers were permanently attached with spiral cords, and featured a numeric keypad, a circular paddle that detected 16 directions, and four rubber buttons on the sides of the controller. Most games came with small plastic overlays that could be inserted into the controller over the keypad, to help players learn and remember game controls. One disadvantage to the controller was its inability to use the disc and keypad inputs at the same time, making \"run &amp; gun\" tactics difficult for games that used the disc for movement and the keypad for firing. The most popular solution to this problem involved using one controller's disc to move and the other controller's keypad to shoot. The controller's side buttons posed another problem, as they were very stiff and unresponsive, making games that utilized them difficult, and extended gameplay painful on thumbs.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Although the Intellivision was more powerful, it was never as popular as the Atari 2600, which had more popular games because developers were more interested in exploring the possibilities of the 2600's capabilities. Due to excessive competition in the console market that brought about the \"video game crash\" of 1983, game sales for the Intellivision tanked, and in 1984 Mattel Electronics was shut down by its parent company Mattel. The rights to the Intellivision name brand and its games were eventually bought by <a href=\"\/intv\/3010-2047\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2047\">INTV Corporation<\/a>, who made new consoles and introduced new games slowly over time.

            "description": "<p>The iPad is <a data-ref-id=\"3010-5815\" href=\"\/apple-inc\/3010-5815\/\">Apple<\/a>'s foray into a new consumer electronics territory called tablet computing. The device uses a 9.7\" multi-touch screen and runs Apple's iOS mobile operating system, based on OS X. Similar to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-96\" href=\"\/iphone\/3045-96\/\">iPhone<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-96\" href=\"\/iphone\/3045-96\/\">iPod Touch<\/a>, the iPad features minimal use of physical buttons, providing only for Power, the Home screen, volume control, and an orientation lock which prevents the tablet's display from rotating with the user's movement, which can be configured to mute the iPad instead. It gained many good reviews from critics when it launched on April 3rd 2010, and sold 3 million units in 80 days.<\/p><h2>Configurations<\/h2><p>The iPad has two models on that runs on wifi and the other has a 3G network. The 3G version has a $130 premium. The launch prices are as follows.<\/p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Model<\/th><th>16 GB<\/th><th>32 GB<\/th><th>64 GB<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>WiFi<\/b><\/td><td>$499<\/td><td>$599<\/td><td>$699<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>WiFi 3G<\/b><\/td><td>$629<\/td><td>$729<\/td><td>$829<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><p>All six configurations and even their prices have remained the same for iPad 2 and iPad 3 launches. However, alongside the launch of both newer-model iPads, the price of the previous iteration may receive a price cut until stock is cleared.<\/p><p><a data-ref-id=\"3040-9951\" href=\"\/steve-jobs\/3040-9951\/\">Steve Jobs<\/a> has said that there is room to lower pricing in the future if necessary. To date this has not happened. Instead, the iPad has received yearly model revisions to improve the value proposition, with things like upgraded specs, and added features such as cameras, tilt sensor, and retina display.<\/p><h2>iPhone\/iPod Touch apps<\/h2><p>iPhone\/iPod Touch apps and games are compatible with the iPad, and can be run at original resolution or a full-screen \"double\" resolution. The iPad also features exclusive games, which can be run by the more powerful 1 GHz processor with the 256 MB of memory.<\/p><h2>iBooks<\/h2><p>One of the key features of the iPad is its iBooks support. iBooks are essentially .pub formatted documents which is presented similarly to how a normal book would look. iBooks can be purchased from the iBooks Store and will be available to iPhone users as well later in the year with iPhone OS 4.0.<\/p><h2>iPad's 3G Plan<\/h2><p>Although the iPad 3G adds a $130 premium, the deal Apple struck with AT&amp;T for the iPad's 3G plan is a pay as you go plan with no contract and no added fees. You purchase time through itunes, using the credit card that you have on file with Apple, or a unique one for AT&amp;T. Prices start at $14.99 a month for limited access and $29.99 a month for unlimited access (both include free use at AT&amp;T hotspots). Some of the features in the plan include no billing, no checks, no pay by phone surcharges, no added set up fees, and cancel at any time.<\/p><p>Verizon has a tiered data plan. The cheapest is $20 a month for 1 GB, and the most expensive plan is $80 a month for 10 GB.<\/p><h2>Game Center<\/h2><p>Game Center is an unified log-in for iPad games which allows match-making, friends lists, achievements, leader-boards, and online play. Game Center has been compared to Microsoft's <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1404\" href=\"\/xbox-live\/3015-1404\/\">Xbox LIVE<\/a> service.<\/p><h2>iPad 2<\/h2><p>The second generation iPad was released in March 2011. It features a thinner case, forward and back facing camera, and the Apple A5 core processor.<\/p><h2>iPad 3<\/h2><p>The third generation iPad, released in March 2012, has the Apple A5X dual-core processor and was the first iPad with a ''retina display''. It has a higher resolution than HDTV's, with such a high pixel density that they cannot be seen with the naked eye.<\/p><h2>iPad 4<\/h2><p>The fourth generation iPad was released in November 2012, breaking the annual cycle of the release of iPads for the first time. It saw the introduction of Lightning connectors on iPads, a HD front-facing camera and an Apple A6X processor.<\/p><h2>iPad mini<\/h2><p>The iPad mini was Apple's first tablet smaller than 9.7\", measuring 7.9\" in diameter, and weighing significantly less. It was released in November 2012 alongside the iPad 4. It had the same specs as an iPad 2, with a smaller, non-retina screen and a HD front-facing camera.<\/p><h2>Foxconn controversy<\/h2><p>Apple products are manufactured by a Taiwanese manufacturing company named Foxconn which has a track record of employee suicides. At least 14 suicides are confirmed in 2010. Long working hours and racial discrimination are cited as potential contributing factors.<\/p><p>There has also been evidence reported of illegal overtime and failure by Foxconn management to report accidents. Workers complained they were forced to stand for more then eight hours at a time.<\/p><p>In 2011, Apple admitted that they were finding <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/technology\/apple\/8324867\/Apples-child-labour-issues-worsen.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">more and more child laborers in their factories<\/a>.<\/p>",

            "description": "<h2>About<\/h2><p>iPhone is a smartphone designed by <a href=\"\/apple-inc\/3010-5815\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-5815\">Apple<\/a>, sold in many countries and on many mobile carriers. What makes iPhone special from past mobile phones is its minimalist design and heavily reliance on a touch screen instead of buttons. iPhone sports many features that make it attractive as not only a phone, but a general purpose computing device. More importantly, iPhone has recently gained a massive foothold in the handheld gaming market through the App Store, allowing users to easily download apps from the device itself. With iPhone's massive popularity and considered by many to be their primary gaming platform, major publishers such as <a href=\"\/gameloft-china\/3010-6003\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6003\">Gameloft<\/a>, <a href=\"\/ea-games\/3010-6256\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6256\">EA<\/a>, <a href=\"\/epic-games\/3010-149\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-149\">Epic Games<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega<\/a> have all released games for iPhone.<\/p><h2>Specifications<\/h2><p>The iPhone is a very capable platform in terms of processing power. It has a 620 MHz ARM 1176 underclocked to 400 MHz processor, 128 MB eDRAM as well as a PowerVR MBX graphics processing unit. This allows it to run 3D and sprite-based games which put most phones' graphical capabilities to shame. Graphics are run through OpenGL, however it is the less-powerful Embedded System version. The iPhone 3GS has a 833 MHz ARM Cortex-A8 underclocked to 600 MHz, 256 MB eDRAM, and a PowerVR SGX GPU.<\/p><p>The iPhone 4 has the ARM Cortex-A8CPU integrated with a PowerVR SGX 535 GPU and 515 MB eDRAM.<\/p><p>There are some issues for running games on the iPhone, the main one being a lack of a tactile input. The iPhone is controlled via a combination of a touch screen, which can recognize multiple points of contact, as well as an accelerometer, which can sense movement of the device. These methods of input can work well for many genres, including racing, puzzle, and adventure games. However the lack of physical button-based input can inhibit more traditional action-based games, platformers, etc. due to the finger needing to obscure the screen. <a href=\"\/virtual-joystick\/3015-4951\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4951\">Virtual buttons<\/a> may be used instead, but that takes up space on the rather small screen and lacks tactile feedback and the ability to be pressure sensitive. Unlike the <a href=\"\/nintendo-ds\/3045-52\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS<\/a>, the iPhone's screen is not sensitive to physical pressure, but only disturbances through bioelectric contact such as skin -- the former being known as resistive and the latter capacitive. This is why using a plastic stylus or most inorganic objects will not register input.<\/p><h2>Different Models<\/h2><p>Since the original iPhone release, Apple have upgraded the model year over year in a tick-tock fashion, adding new features one year and a complete redesign the next. The iPhone 3G boasted a new streamlined design, replacing the aluminum backing for a more suited black plastic. It also introduced 3G to the iPhone, which was a feature that many critics complained about the original not having, considering it was a smartphone and a GPS. The iPhone 3GS released in 2009 claimed to be \"twice as fast\" as the 3G (the S is for Speed), it also has a 3.0 megapixel camera that takes stills and video, compared to the iPhone and the 3G's fixed focus 2.0 megapixel camera, which could not record video. Additionally, the 3GS added a digital compass.<\/p><p>In June 2010, the iPhone 4 was released. The iPhone was vastly improved now, with a faster CPU, a higher resolution \"retina\" display, noise suppressing dual microphones, a 5.0 megapixel camera and a newly added front-facing camera, longer battery life, and a design change which made it distinct from older models.<\/p><h3>iPhone 4S<\/h3><p>On October 4 2011, Apple announced the iPhone 4S. Changes include a new 8MP camera,1080p video recording, an improved antenna, Apple's A5 dual core processor and Siri, a voice controlled assistant. It released on October 14, 2011.<\/p><h3>iPhone 5<\/h3><p>The iPhone 5 was released on September 21, 2012. The phone is slimmer, lighter, and also introduced the first 4\" screen. It was also the first iPhone to support LTE. Apple put a their new A6 processor, and added 1GB of RAM.<\/p><h3>iPhone 5s and 5c<\/h3><p>The iPhone 5s and 5c were announced on September 10, 2013 and launched on September 20, 2013. The iPhone 5s uses a 64-bit A7 processor, while the lower-end iPhone 5c uses the A6 processor previously used in the iPhone 5. The iPhone 5s also adds a fingerprint scanner, which is not present on the iPhone 5c. Fingerprint data is stored within a \"secure enclave\" on the A7 chip.<\/p><h3>iPhone 6 and 6 Plus<\/h3><p>On September 19th, 2014, Apple announced it's 5th major redesign of the iPhone, the iPhone 6, with a 4.7\" screen. In addition, Apple unprecedentedly release two different models, with the iPhone 6 Plus having a 5.5\" screen. These models improved on the previous generations with the A8 SoC and M8 coprocessor, and expanded LTE connectivity.<\/p><h3>iPhone 6s and 6s Plus<\/h3><p>The newest models were released on September 25th, 2015 with identical physical design of the previous generation. This \"S\" variation introduced some very significant internal improvements, however, with a vastly superior Touch ID sensor and the introduction of 3D Touch. As with other releases, the new generation also included updated chips with the A9 and M9 processors.<\/p><h2>Jailbreaking<\/h2><p>Jailbreaking is a process that allows the iPhone and iPod Touch to run unsigned code on, bypassing Apple's official distribution platform, the App Store. Once jailbroken, iPhone users are able to download many applications previously unavailable through the App Store due to Apple's rules.<\/p><p>Jailbreaking is <a href=\"https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT201954\" rel=\"nofollow\">heavily discouraged<\/a> by Apple, and according to the Terms of Service, technically voids the warranty. Apple's official stance is that they \"may deny service\" for any device with unauthorized software installed, so in most cases removing the unauthorized software will bring the device back under the warranty guidelines.<\/p><h2>The iPod Touch<\/h2><p>The iPod Touch looks a lot like the iPhone, but there are a few key differences between the two. The most notable of these differences is the fact that the iPod touch does not have a GSM radio built into it, and therefore cannot use a cellular network with which to make phone calls or access the internet, though it does include Wi-Fi. The first generations did not have a built-in camera or microphone, but the second generation (2G, 2008) of the hardware does include an internal speaker and adds support for an external microphone. The fourth generation (4G, 2010) now includes a built-in microphone and also a camera which can record both images and video. Like the iPhone, the iPod touch runs iPhone OS. The iPhone OS 3.0 on the iPod touch unlocks Bluetooth (for 2G touch), landscape keyboard in more apps, peer-to-peer gameplay, and several other new features. The iPod Touch functions much like the iPhone, but is slightly smaller, lighter, and can be purchased without a phone contract.<\/p><h2>Game Center<\/h2><p>Game Center is Apple's gaming platform for the iPod Touch, iPhone and <a href=\"\/ipad\/3045-121\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-121\">iPad<\/a>, which was announced as part of the iPhone OS 4.0 on April 8, 2010. The new platform will work as a social gaming network, with the ability to track friends and invite them to games, matchmaking, <a href=\"\/leaderboard\/3015-30\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-30\">leaderboards<\/a> and <a href=\"\/achievements\/3015-29\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-29\">achievements<\/a>. Game Center will replace other gaming networks on the iPhone such as <a href=\"\/openfeint\/3015-4240\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4240\">OpenFeint<\/a>, and allow for a more wholesome experience. The network was supposed to launch as part of iPhone OS 4.0 in June 2010, but was delayed to September 2010.<\/p>",

It was never intended as a real gaming platform but due to it's incredible popularity, hackers put homebrewed games on it, and eventually Apple released a proper games section in the iTunes Store. iPod games are not available at retail, only as digital downloads, and they are linked to the specific device once they are purchased. iPod games cannot be shared or transferred. No external controller is available for the Apple iPod, and most games made use of the clickwheel using innovative, and often considered lacking, control schemes. All iPod games were available for $4.99 each from iTunes.<\/p><h2>History of Games<\/h2><p>The Apple iPod first generation included Brick as a built in game, a simple <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13049\" href=\"\/breakout\/3030-13049\/\" slug=\"breakout\">breakout<\/a> clone that was playable while listening to music. Originally it was an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2\" href=\"\/easter-egg\/3015-2\/\" slug=\"easter-egg\">easter egg<\/a> on the device, but in later <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1789\" href=\"\/firmware\/3015-1789\/\" slug=\"firmware\">firmware<\/a> updates it was added to the menu. The fifth generation clickwheel iPod devices shipped with 3 more built in games: Parachute, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-27477\" href=\"\/music-quiz\/3030-27477\/\" slug=\"music-quiz\">Music Quiz<\/a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5742\" href=\"\/microsoft-solitaire\/3030-5742\/\" slug=\"microsoft-solitaire\">Solitaire<\/a>. Parachute is similar to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4062\" href=\"\/missile-command\/3030-4062\/\" slug=\"missile-command\">Missile Command<\/a>, in which the player controls a turret at the bottom of the screen and shoots incoming paratroopers. Music Quiz is a game that plays a clip of music from the iPod's library and asks the player a question about it. Solitaire is a portable version of the popular card game. The sixth generation iPod and newer iPod Nanos ship with Vortex, iQuiz and Klondike. In September 2006, Apple launched iTunes 7, and added the game store for clickwheel iPods fifth generation and up. Touch-screen iPods have an entirely different application store. iTunes 7 launched with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14169\" href=\"\/bejeweled\/3030-14169\/\" slug=\"bejeweled\">Bejeweled<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8785\" href=\"\/cubis-2\/3030-8785\/\" slug=\"cubis-2\">Cubis 2<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8020\" href=\"\/ea-mahjong\/3030-8020\/\" slug=\"ea-mahjong\">Mahjong<\/a>, Mini Golf, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7624\" href=\"\/pac-man\/3030-7624\/\" slug=\"pac-man\">Pac-Man<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1896\" href=\"\/tetris\/3030-1896\/\" slug=\"tetris\">Tetris<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9467\" href=\"\/texas-hold-em\/3030-9467\/\" slug=\"texas-hold-em\">Texas Hold 'Em<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9146\" href=\"\/vortex\/3030-9146\/\" slug=\"vortex\">Vortex<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17012\" href=\"\/zuma\/3030-17012\/\" slug=\"zuma\">Zuma<\/a> all for $4.99 each.<\/p><h2><b>iPod History<\/b><\/h2><h3>iPod \"Classic\" 2001 - Present<\/h3><p>Generations:<\/p><ul><li>One: 2001, 5 and 10 GB<\/li><li>Two: 2002, 10 and 20 GB<\/li><li>Three: 2003, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 GB<\/li><li>Four: 2004, 20 and 40 GB<\/li><li>Five: 2005, 30, 60 and 80 GB<\/li><li>Six: 2007, 80 and 160 GB<\/li><li>Six (Refresh): 2008, 120 GB (80 and 160 GB Models discontinued)<\/li><li>Six (Refresh 2): 2009, 160 GB (120 Slim body) (120 GB discontinued)<\/li><\/ul><h3>iPod Mini 2004 - 2005<\/h3><p>Generations:<\/p><ul><li>One: 2004, 4 GB<\/li><li>Two: 2005, 4 and 6 GB<\/li><\/ul><h3>iPod Shuffle 2005 - Present (no screen)<\/h3><table class=\"t-editor with-border natural-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Generation<\/th><th>Years Released<\/th><th>Storage (GB)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>One<\/td><td>2005<\/td><td>0.5, 1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Two<\/td><td>2006, 2007, 2008<\/td><td>1, 2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Three<\/td><td>2009<\/td><td>2, 4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Four<\/td><td>2010<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h3>iPod Nano 2005 - Present (use <a data-ref-id=\"3045-72\" href=\"\/ipod\/3045-72\/\" slug=\"ipod\"><b>IPOD<\/b><\/a> platform for iPod Classic compatible games)<\/h3><table class=\"t-editor with-border natural-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Generation<\/th><th>Year<\/th><th>Storage (GB)<\/th><th>RAM (MB)<\/th><th>Display<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>One<\/td><td>2005<\/td><td>1, 2, 4<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>176x132 @ 151ppi<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Two<\/td><td>2006<\/td><td>2, 4, 8<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>176x132 @ 151ppi<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Three<\/td><td>2007<\/td><td>4, 8<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>320x240 @ 204ppi<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Four<\/td><td>2008<\/td><td>8, 16<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>240x320 @ 204ppi<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Five<\/td><td>2009<\/td><td>8, 16<\/td><td>64<\/td><td>240x376 @ 204ppi<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Six<\/td><td>2010<\/td><td>8, 16<\/td><td>64<\/td><td>240x240 @ 220ppi<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h3>iPod Touch 2007 - Present (use <a data-ref-id=\"3045-96\" href=\"\/iphone\/3045-96\/\" slug=\"iphone\"><b>IPHN<\/b><\/a> platform for iOS compatible App Store games)<\/h3><table class=\"t-editor with-border natural-width\"><tbody><tr><th>Generation<\/th><th>Year<\/th><th>Storage (GB)<\/th><th>iOS versions<\/th><th>RAM (MB)<\/th><th>Display<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>One<\/td><td>2007<\/td><td>8, 16, 32<\/td><td>1.1 \u2013 3.1.3<\/td><td>128<\/td><td>480x320 @ 162ppi<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Two<\/td><td>2008<\/td><td>8, 16, 32<\/td><td>2.1.1 \u2013 4.2.1<\/td><td>128<\/td><td>480x320 @ 162ppi<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Three<\/td><td>2009<\/td><td>32, 64<\/td><td>3.1.1 \u2013 4.2.1<\/td><td>256<\/td><td>480x320 @ 162ppi<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Four<\/td><td>2010<\/td><td>8, 32, 64<\/td><td>4.1 \u2013 4.2.1<\/td><td>256<\/td><td>960x640 @ 326ppi<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h2>Notable Games<\/h2><p>While the iPod gained develop support from popular developers such as <a data-ref-id=\"3010-382\" href=\"\/namco-bandai-games-inc\/3010-382\/\" slug=\"namco-bandai-games-inc\">NAMCO<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-104\" href=\"\/square-enix\/3010-104\/\" slug=\"square-enix\">Square Enix<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-62\" href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" slug=\"sega\">Sega<\/a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6256\" href=\"\/ea-games\/3010-6256\/\" slug=\"ea-games\">EA<\/a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-419\" href=\"\/hudson-entertainment-inc\/3010-419\/\" slug=\"hudson-entertainment-inc\">Hudson<\/a>, the game library remained rather small.

            "deck": "The Atari Jaguar was the first 64-Bit game console, and Atari's final console.",
            "description": "<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>After an absence from the video game console market since the demise of the 7800 system in 1991, <a href=\"\/atari\/3010-182\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-182\">Atari<\/a> made its return with the Jaguar. The system was released in 1993 in <a href=\"\/san-francisco\/3035-191\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-191\">San Francisco<\/a> and in 1994 for the rest of <a href=\"\/the-united-states-of-america\/3035-396\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">America<\/a> and <a href=\"\/europe\/3035-289\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-289\">Europe<\/a>. Unfortunately, the Jaguar was a commercial failure that left the company financially crippled. It was the last console Atari produced.<\/p><p>In the early 1990s, Atari was negotiating with a British company called Flare Technology, who had designed the unreleased Konix Multisystem console. Atari was impressed by the work Flare had done on the Konix, and provided to the funding to found a new company, Flare 2. Flare 2 started development on two consoles, the 32-bit Panther and the 64-bit Jaguar. Eventually, after seeing the Jaguar's graphical abilities, Atari ceased work on Panther and focused their attention on the more powerful Jaguar. They aimed to surpass the abilities of the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo, and compete against the new generation of consoles in development by <a href=\"\/the-3do-company\/3010-224\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-224\">3DO<\/a>, <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega<\/a>, while still remaining cost effective. Despite the Panther's cancellation, some games developed for it saw release. For example, the game <a href=\"\/cybermorph\/3030-9922\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9922\">Cybermorph<\/a> that came bundled with the Atari Jaguar was a game designed for Panther.<\/p><h2>64-bit?<\/h2><p>Atari advertised the Jaguar aggressively in the press with its \"Do the Math\" campaign; boasting about its technical superiority over the 16-bit platforms, and claiming to be the first 64-bit home console on the market. While the Jaguar was certainly more powerful than the <a href=\"\/snes\/3045-9\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo<\/a> and <a href=\"\/genesis\/3045-6\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Genesis<\/a> in most respects, these claims caused some controversy.<\/p><p>Many technically knowledgeable industry insiders and gamers claimed that the Jaguar was not a true 64-bit platform, because the Jaguar\u2019s Motorola 68000 CPU chip was only 16\/32-bit (like in 16-bit systems), and the primary GPU delivered a 32-bit instruction set. The complaint is similar to the earlier argument that the <a href=\"\/turbografx-16\/3045-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-55\">TurboGrafx-16<\/a> was actually an 8-bit system, since it was based around an 8-bit CPU (but with 16-bit video chips), and equally gray.<\/p><p>A major contributor to this issue was the industry's desire to use \"bits\" as a concrete measure of subjective \"impressiveness.\" With Sega and Nintendo promoting 16-bit systems as vastly superior to previous 8-bit systems, gamers naturally expected a similar, obvious jump in quality with the Jaguar. In theory, 64-bit games should have been 4x as impressive as 16-bit systems (as frequently cited when the Jaguar is compared to the <a href=\"\/\">Nintendo 64<\/a>). In reality, this is misunderstanding the meaning of \"bits,\" and applying some wishful thinking toward rating a console's performance by a simple number.<\/p><p>Ultimately, due to Jaguar's chip set architecture and processing methods, there was just enough to backup Atari\u2019s 64-bit claim. The design, if always followed as intended, would indeed utilise 64-bit graphical processing and buck claims of the Jaguar being simply \"two 32-bit chips glued together.\" Unfortunately, the architecture proved difficult for third-party developers to utilize effectively, and made porting games less profitable - a situation echoed by developers' issues with the <a href=\"\/playstation-3\/3045-35\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">Playstation 3<\/a>. Thus the games most often fell short of the system's theoretical potential.<\/p><p>Jaguar <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jaguarsector.com\/index.php?showforum=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">programming enthusiasts<\/a> looking over dumped code from retail titles have suggested many companies treated the Motorola CPU as the main processing unit, instead of as a controller for the 64-bit Tom and Jerry \"workhorse\" chips as Atari intended. This would artificially limit the machine's capabilities, and has been cited as the primary reason for choppy performance in some games (<a href=\"\/checkered-flag\/3030-12786\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12786\">Checkered Flag<\/a> is a specific example). It is unclear as to how frequently this occurred, and if it was due to poor documentation from Atari, or simply that developers were more familiar with the common 68000 chip.<\/p><h2>Legacy<\/h2><p>The Jaguar platform did boast some well-received games, including <a href=\"\/alien-vs-predator\/3030-8142\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8142\">Alien VS Predator<\/a>, <a href=\"\/doom\/3030-7326\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\">Doom<\/a> and <a href=\"\/tempest-2000\/3030-8496\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8496\">Tempest 2000<\/a>, but the graphical leap from 16-bit systems was not extreme, contrary to the expectations Sega had created. Indeed, a large number of Jaguar releases were ports of games released on the Genesis and the Super Nintendo.<\/p><p>The Jaguar was a powerful system for its time, with many of the units being sold to the loyal and dedicated Atari fan base that had built up since the early 1980\u2018s. Many clever and innovative ideas for the system were in the pipeline, most of which never made it past the prototype phase because of poor sales and short life span of the console.<\/p><p>The Jaguar\u2019s success was hindered by a number of contributing factors, such as a limited game library, third party software development issues, and fierce competition in the form of <a href=\"\/sony-corporation\/3010-3223\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3223\">Sony<\/a>\u2019s <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega<\/a>\u2019s <a href=\"\/saturn\/3045-42\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-42\">Saturn<\/a>, which finally finished off the Jaguar by mid-1996.<\/p><p>In the late 1990\u2019s <a href=\"\/hasbro-interactive-inc\/3010-531\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-531\">Hasbro interactive<\/a> bought out all Atari properties and declared the Jaguar an open platform for homebrew development. Today the Atari Jaguar has a loyal cult following, who use the console for all sorts of development, including utilizing the COM <a href=\"\/lynx\/3045-7\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-7\">Lynx<\/a> and \"CatBox\" device for the networking of up to 32 Jaguar consoles.<\/p><h2>Specifications<\/h2><h3>First Chip - Tom Chip (26.59 MHz)<\/h3><ul><li><ul><li>Graphics processing unit (GPU) \u2013 32-bit RISC architecture, 4 KB internal cache.<\/li><li>Object Processor \u2013 64-bit RISC architecture.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Blitter \u2013 64-bit RISC architecture; high speed logic operations, z-buffering and Gouraud shading, with 64-bit internal registers.<\/li><li>DRAM controller, 32-bit memory management.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Second Chip - Jerry Chip (26.59 MHz)<\/h3><ul><li>Digital Signal Processor \u2013 32-bit RISC architecture, 8 KB internal cache.

While other consoles do this at the software level, Jaguar consoles are PAL or NTSC specific, and the cartridges themselves are commonly agnostic. This is why most Jaguar packaging is in English, French, and German. Production costs were saved by printing one cart type and selling it worldwide.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/2090429-jag_3_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2090429\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.80454545454545\" data-width=\"440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/2090429-jag_3_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2090429\"><img alt=\"Red Screen of Death\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/2090429-jag_3_.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/117445\/2090429-jag_3_.png 440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" data-width=\"440\"><\/a><figcaption>Red Screen of Death<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Jaguar's cartridge port contains no hinged dust cover or similar protection. The port is simply left exposed on the top of the console. Because of this design flaw, contacts on both the console and the cartridges are extremely sensitive to dust, oil, corrosion, or other elements that prevent a solid contact. Poor contact between the cartridge and the console leads to the common \"Red Screen of Death\" on booting the console. Contrary to popular belief, this does not indicate a hardware failure. In nearly every case, the red screen can be cleared by aggressively cleaning the cartridge with mild solvents (alcohol or peroxide) - just blowing on the cart won't usually do.<\/p><h2>U.S. Launch Titles<\/h2><p>The following are launch titles for the Jaguar when it was released in November 1993.<\/p><ul><li><a href=\"\/cybermorph\/3030-9922\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9922\">Cybermorph<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/raiden\/3030-16693\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16693\">Raiden<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/trevor-mcfur-in-the-crescent-galaxy\/3030-19437\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19437\">Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy<\/a><\/li><\/ul>",

            "description": "<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>Linux is a Unix-like operating system created as a free software alternative to other Unix-like operating systems. The core component of any Linux-based operating system is the kernel, which was originally authored by Linus Torvalds and first released in 1991. Linux is typically distributed with user space applications developed from the GNU Project. Because of this, the Free Software Foundation, which created the GNU Project, prefers to refer to the operating system resulting from the combined kernel and applications as GNU\/Linux.<\/p><p>Linux is generally released in a distribution, such as Ubuntu, Gentoo, Debian, or Fedora (though a skilled user could theoretically build it from scratch). These distributions can be commercial, like Red Hat, or free like Ubuntu.<\/p><h2>Creation<\/h2><p>Developer Linus Torvalds created Linux in 1991 due to dissatisfaction with the license restrictions of the MINIX operating system, which only allowed distribution for educational purposes. He initially developed the Linux kernel on MINIX and MINIX applications were used along with it. Development eventually moved to Linux with a GNU user space when the kernel had matured.<\/p><p>Torvalds initially released Linux under a license that restricted commercial distribution, but in 1992, the license was switched to the GNU General Public License (GPL). The GPL is a <a href=\"\/open-source\/3015-2230\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2230\">free software<\/a> license and does not contain the same restrictions as Torvalds' initial license choice. After switching the license to GPL, developers worked on porting the GNU Project applications to Linux, creating what is now commonly referred to as Linux or GNU\/Linux.<\/p><h2>Linux Gaming<\/h2><p>Linux has long been a popular choice for free and open source games like <a href=\"\/nethack\/3030-140\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-140\">NetHack<\/a>. Commercial games started appearing in 1994, when <a href=\"\/id-software\/3010-347\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-347\">ID Software<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/dave-taylor\/3040-1321\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-1321\">Dave Taylor<\/a> ported <a href=\"\/doom\/3030-7326\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\">Doom<\/a> to the platform. With the creation of <a href=\"\/loki-entertainment-software-inc\/3010-2528\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2528\">Loki Software<\/a> in 1998 porting became more common. Former Loki Software programmer <a href=\"\/ryan-c-gordon\/3040-62028\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-62028\">Ryan C. Gordon<\/a> continues to be involved in porting Linux games to this day.<\/p><p>Windows compatibility layers such as <a href=\"\/wine\/3055-3164\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3164\">Wine<\/a> can be used to play games native to Windows on Linux, though it's not typically the best way to play those games. Wine can, however, run the Windows version of the Steam platform on Linux, which has a much greater library than the Linux version. The <a href=\"http:\/\/appdb.winehq.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Wine website<\/a> has a detailed database of games with information on how to run them in Wine.<\/p><p>Indie developers generally support native Linux versions much more than larger publishers, with games like <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/minecraft\/3030-30475\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30475\">Minecraft<\/a> being very successful on the platform.<\/p><p>The <a href=\"\/humble-bundle\/3015-6612\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6612\">Humble Bundle<\/a> debuted in 2010, offering a selection of games to raise money for charity. Games are available for Windows, Mac and Linux, sometimes with games making their Linux debut as part of the bundle. Typical sales for the Linux version of the bundle rank it third, but the Linux users generally pay the highest average amount of money for the bundle(Contributors pay what they want).<\/p><p>In 2013 the <a href=\"\/steam\/3015-718\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam<\/a> digital distribution platform was officially released for Linux along with a variety of games. Although Valve only officially supports this version of Steam on Ubuntu, it can be installed on other distributions. Valve has also confirmed that their version of the \"Steam-box\" will run a version of Linux, though users will be able to install other OS's.<\/p><p>On July 24, 2014, <a href=\"\/gogcom\/3015-2379\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2379\">GOG.com<\/a> officially started supporting Linux (four months after announcing their plans to add Linux support), inititally with a batch of 50 games, with another hundred to be made available in the following months. The games are made sure to work in the Ubuntu and Mint distributions and includes <em>.deb<\/em> installers for ease of use on those (and other Debian derivatives), but also include distro-independent <em>tar.gz<\/em> files.<\/p>",

The project was initially named HD-80 (HD meaning Hemdator, the Swedish word for home computer).<\/p><p>The two companies felt they had the technical expertise to design the computer, but not the means of producing it in the quantities needed, so they pitched the idea to the TV manufacturer Luxor AB, which ended up not only helping with manufacturing the computer, but took a leading role in its development. Early models were tied to repurposed monochrome Luxor TV that both served as the monitor and provided power to the computer, while later models were sold with an external power supply and RF adapter allowing it to be connected to the household's existing TV.<\/p><p>The computer was released in August 1978, initially with Luxor selling the consumer version and Scandia Metric selling their version (re-branded Metric 65) to businesses.<\/p><p>Over the next year they started blaming each other for encroaching on each other's markets however, and went their separate ways - with Luxor released the business model ABC800, and Scandia Metric licensing the Compucorp 655 as their follow-up \"Metric 85\".<\/p><p>The primary market of the computer was Sweden, though the Hungarian company Budapesti R\u00e1di\u00f3technikai Gy\u00e1r produced some under license as the BRG ABC 80.<\/p><p>As IBM PC gained popularity in the early 80s, Luxor unsuccessfully tried to market their ABC 800 line with the slogan \"Who needs IBM compatibility?\". Production ceased in 1986.<\/p>",

            "description": "<h2>History<\/h2><p>The Macintosh was designed as part of a skunkworks operation originally headed by Jef Raskin. Raskin planned to create an easy to use and affordable appliance computer for use by ordinary people. The project was ongoing at the same time as <a href=\"\/apple-inc\/3010-5815\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-5815\">Apple<\/a> founder <a href=\"\/steve-jobs\/3040-9951\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-9951\">Steve Jobs<\/a> was leading development of Lisa, Apple's intended flagship computer. Despite his heavy involvement in the inital stages of the Lisa project, Jobs eventually caught wind of the Macintosh project and gradually turned his full attention to it. In 1981, Raskin departed the team over a dispute with Jobs, making Steve the de facto leader.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/66\/521728-macintosh.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-521728\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.145\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/66\/521728-macintosh.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-521728\"><img alt=\"The Original Macintosh\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/66\/521728-macintosh.gif\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/66\/521728-macintosh.gif 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"><\/a><figcaption>The Original Macintosh<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>It was under Jobs that the Mac became a GUI-oriented computer, influenced by a tour given to Apple staff of Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center which included looks at PARC's Alto computer and the related Smalltalk software. The computer eventually released in 1984 as a vertically-oriented all-in-one and was gradually revised over the course of the decade. Eventually, Apple began to offer Macs in different formats, ranging from standard desktops to early laptops and other portable designs.<\/p><p>The Mac's popularity was at first fairly high, but after Steve Jobs was stripped of power within Apple (eventually departing to form NeXT), executives who did not fully understand the platform began to devalue it (notably, Apple was criticized in the nineties for offering an absurd amount of Macs which were too similar and had generic names) and the platform struggled. To compound these problems, Apple's Mac System (later Mac OS), the OS powering the Macs, was hopelessly outdated and needed replacing.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, Apple's internal software R&amp;D had become bloated and ineffectual, stalling development on the next-generation Mac OS codenamed Copland. In 1996, Apple wrote it off as a sinking ship and decided to source the basis for their next-generation operating system from elsewhere. Several options were considered, such as licensing Microsoft's NT architecture and purchasing Be, Inc. for its BeOS. In the end though, it was Apple founder Steve Jobs and his NeXT outfit which Apple decided to buy, allowing them to base what would become OS X (as in the roman numeral for 10) on NeXT's powerful and robust OpenSTEP OS.<\/p><p>This also brought Jobs back into the company. He quickly assumed control and began to turn the Mac platform around. Jobs trimmed the bloat from the product line and steadily began to focus on releasing stylish computers like the iMac and iBook for consumers and powerhouses for the Mac's creative professional base like the PowerBook and PowerMac lines.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/66\/428003-imac2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-428003\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/66\/428003-imac2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-428003\"><img alt=\"iMac, Apple's Flagship Mac\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/66\/428003-imac2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/66\/428003-imac2.jpg 900w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/66\/428003-imac2.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/66\/428003-imac2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>iMac, Apple's Flagship Mac<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Since then, the Mac has become known as a stylish computer for the image conscious, as well as a great tool for artists, writers, film editors and so on. Since approximately halfway through the first decade of the 21st Century, Apple has begun to play up the Mac as a games platform, something for which it had developed a reputation for being poor at. This took several forms, most visibly the appearance of <a href=\"\/electronic-arts\/3010-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">EA<\/a> at an Apple event to promote the fact that they were bringing a number of games to the platform.<\/p><p>Despite the perception of the Mac as a second-rate games platform (by comparison to the dominant Windows PC), it has played host to a number of popular exclusives, most notably much of <a href=\"\/bungie-studios\/3010-476\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-476\">Bungie's<\/a> earlier games (before the Microsoft buyout) catalog. In fact, Bungie's <a href=\"\/halo-combat-evolved\/3030-2600\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\">Halo<\/a>, a huge hit for the Xbox, was originally a Mac exclusive, built on <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/opengl\/3015-5192\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5192\">OpenGL<\/a>. The game later found its way onto Mac as a port of the PC release.<\/p><h3> <\/h3><h2>Gaming on the Macintosh<\/h2><h3>Mac OSX 10.13 \"High Sierra\" Improvements<\/h3><p>With the release of Mac OSX 10.13 \"High Sierra\" came a number of improvements through Apples graphical API called \"Metal 2\" by introducing; virtual reality, machine learning and possibly the most welcomed is support for external GPU's (eGPU) to improve gaming and media experience.<\/p><h3>Windows Gaming on the Mac<\/h3><p>On April 5, 2006 Apple released a beta version of a new piece of software called Boot Camp. Due to the recent change in architecture - PowerPC to Intel - Mac and Windows computers were now more similar than ever. Boot Camp embraced this by allowing the user to install Windows on a Mac. Windows XP - and later Windows Vista and 7 - now ran natively on Macintosh computers, making gaming on Mac's easier than ever.<\/p><p>With the release of Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard), Boot Camp comes pre-installed on all Mac's and is thus officially supported by Apple. Although many Mac users are unwilling to install Windows on their computer, Boot Camp still offers Mac users something they've never had before - the ability to run any PC game 100% natively.<\/p><h3>Steam for Mac<\/h3><p>On March 8th, 2010, <a href=\"\/valve-corporation\/3010-1374\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\">Valve<\/a> announced that it would begin a new <a href=\"\/steam\/3015-718\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam<\/a> program for the Mac. Under this new system, Valve games would be able to run natively on the Mac, and 3rd parties would be able to release a Mac version of their game on Steam. Also announced is a program called Steam Play, where players who buy the Mac version of a game will also be able to download the PC version of the same game free of charge. Steam for Mac was released on May 12, 2010.<\/p><h3>Mac App Store<\/h3><p>Mimicking their strategy with the <a href=\"\/iphone\/3045-96\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iOS<\/a> platform, Apple has recently added an integrated App Store to the Mac OS. Users can purchase Applications in the same way as on iOS. Apps are then downloaded to a user's system and the App Store App itself keeps track of updates for these Apps. In addition, once an App is purchased, users are free to install it on any other Mac computer by logging into the Mac App Store with the same Apple Account.<\/p><p>This service, just like on iOS, extends to games and already a number of Publishers have made classic and more recent titles available for purchase on the Mac App Store. These games range from recent and current hits to old favourites, to popular indie games like the <a href=\"\/penny-arcade-adventures-on-the-rain-slick-precipice-of-darkness-episode-one\/3030-20696\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20696\">Penny Arcade Adventures<\/a> episodes and also ports of existing iOS games like <a href=\"\/angry-birds\/3025-1879\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1879\">Angry Birds<\/a>.<\/p>",

            "description": "<h2>History<\/h2><p>The MSX home computer architecture standard was conceived by <a href=\"\/ascii-corporation\/3010-805\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-805\">ASCII Microsoft<\/a> executive <a href=\"\/kazuhiko-nishio\/3040-92150\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-92150\">Kazuhiko Nishi<\/a>. Inspired by the success of VHS as a standard for video cassette recorders he had proposed the MSX standard as a single industry standard for home computers. This was many years before the <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a> later became a standardized home computer architecture.<\/p><p>The MSX standard was first formally announced in 1983 and was followed by three other standards: MSX2 (1986), MSX2 (1988) and MSX turbo R (1990).<\/p><p>Over a hundred different companies have manufactured MSX computers. The list of companies includes: <a href=\"\/sony-computer-entertainment-america\/3010-313\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-313\">Sony<\/a>, <a href=\"\/panasonic-interactive-media\/3010-1546\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1546\">Panasonic<\/a>, Sanyo, JVC, Spectravideo, <a href=\"\/toshiba-corporation\/3010-2638\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2638\">Toshiba<\/a>, Canon, <a href=\"\/casio-co-ltd\/3010-2008\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2008\">Casio<\/a>, Dragon, Dyndata, <a href=\"\/fujitsu\/3010-6596\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6596\">Fujitsu<\/a>, Hitachi, Sharp\/Epcom, <a href=\"\/pioneer-productions\/3010-845\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-845\">Pioneer<\/a>, Alalamia, Mitsubishi, NEC, <a href=\"\/philips-interactive-media-inc\/3010-48\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-48\">Philips<\/a>, Radiola, Schneider, Talent, Telematica, Yamaha, Yashica, Aster International, General, Samsung, Hyosung, Limco, Oric, Radofin.<\/p><p>Although it was developed by Microsoft's Japanese partner, Microsoft itself showed little support for the project beyond making the system software, and the MSX-based machines were seldom seen in the <a href=\"\/the-united-states-of-america\/3035-396\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">United States<\/a>.

The problem was that if the internal memory on the phone (3 MB) had been fully used up, then the phone would start using memory from the phones Ram. This meant that the phone would no longer have enough memory to start up the phone or even open the main menu to delete the files taking up the memory. Once this problem occurs if you turn off the N gage then it will no longer work, when turned back on the N gage would show a white screen and stay that way until the phone was switched off, now known as the white screen of death. Another problem with this was that there was and still isn't anyway to fix the N gage after getting the white screen of death, the only known way of fixing is for it to be sent to an official Nokia store.<\/p><h2>N-Gage Arena<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19490\/765403-1online.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-765403\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1818181818182\" data-width=\"176\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 176px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:118.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19490\/765403-1online.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-765403\"><img alt=\"Tiger Woods fully supported online\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px\" data-width=\"176\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19490\/765403-1online.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19490\/765403-1online.jpg 176w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tiger Woods fully supported online\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19490\/765403-1online.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/19490\/765403-1online.jpg 176w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px\" data-width=\"176\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Tiger Woods fully supported online<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The N-Gage also fully supported online play with some games, N-Gage arena allowed players to play against other people wherever they were, even with no wi-fi connectivity at all. However N-Gage Arena had problems, such as having to register with your network provider, which was a problem as some networks did not allow N gage Arena despite working on the N-Gage console. Arena also suffered from lag problems and slow down and was sadly never used by many players, meaning that the people who did play on N-Gage Arena could rarely find another player to play with, however Nokia still even today supports N-Gage Arena in some countries (such as UK) and still works just as well as it originally did.<\/p><p>N-Gage Arena was also used in some games as a global high score service. Some games, such as <a href=\"\/atari-masterpieces-vol-1\/3030-24133\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24133\">Atari Masterpieces Vol. 1<\/a> used this service so players could compare their scores with people from all over the world.<\/p><h2>N-Gage today<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15035\/705192-ngage_profile.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-705192\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3060109289617\" data-width=\"183\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 183px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:130.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15035\/705192-ngage_profile.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-705192\"><img alt=\"The New N-Gage service\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 183px) 100vw, 183px\" data-width=\"183\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15035\/705192-ngage_profile.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15035\/705192-ngage_profile.jpg 183w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The New N-Gage service\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15035\/705192-ngage_profile.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/15035\/705192-ngage_profile.jpg 183w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 183px) 100vw, 183px\" data-width=\"183\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The New N-Gage service<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In 2008 Nokia released a mobile gaming service, under the N-Gage brand. The company dropped the idea of combining cellphones with handheld gaming devices, and chose to make N-gage a part of their Ovi internet services instead. This service is only available on certain Nokia smartphones running the company's S60 software platform, including several Nseries, Eseries and XpressMusic phones. The revamped N-gage service resembles Microsoft's <a href=\"\/xbox-live\/3015-1404\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1404\">Xbox Live<\/a>, with additions like N-Gage points, and gamer profiles.<\/p><p>With the N-Gage platform games are downloaded to the phone, and doesn't support the game cartridges the old N-gage system used. That means there is no backwards compatibility whatsoever. Several first generation N-gage games were ported over to the new platform. It was announced in October 2009 that the service would be shut down by the end of 2010.<\/p><h2>Nokia n85<\/h2><p>Nokia's most recent phone with a capacity comparing to the Android.<\/p><p>n85 Specs:<\/p><p>Dimensions<\/p><ul><li>Form: Two-way slider<\/li><li>Volume: 76 cc<\/li><li>Weight: 128 g<\/li><li>Dimensions: 103 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 16.0 mm<\/li><\/ul><p>Two-way slider with spring assistance mechanism<\/p><h3>Memory<\/h3><ul><li>microSD memory card slot, hot swappable, max. 32 GB (After firmware update)<\/li><li>128 MB internal dynamic memory<\/li><li>78 MB internal NAND flash memory<\/li><\/ul><h3>Data Network<\/h3><ul><li>HSDPA, maximum speed 3.6 Mbps (DL)<\/li><li>WCDMA 900\/1900\/2100, maximum speed PS 384\/384 kbps (UL\/DL)<\/li><li>EDGE class B, multislot class 32, maximum speed 296\/177.6 kbps (DL\/UL)<\/li><li>GPRS class A, multislot class 32, maximum speed 107\/64.2 kbps (DL\/UL)<\/li><li>HSCSD, maximum speed 43.2 kbit\/s<\/li><li>CSD<\/li><li>WLAN 802.11b, 802.11g <ul><li>WLAN Security: WPA2-Enterprise, WPA2-Personal, WPA-Enterprise, WPA-Personal, WEP<\/li><li>WLAN Quality of Service: WMM, U-APSD<\/li><li>WLAN wizard<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>TCP\/IP support<\/li><li>Capability to serve as data modem<\/li><\/ul><h3>Display and User Interface<\/h3><ul><li>Size: 2.6\"<\/li><li>Resolution: 320 \u00d7 240 pixels (QVGA)<\/li><li>Up to 16.7 million colours<\/li><li>Active Matrix OLED technology<\/li><\/ul><h3>Power Management<\/h3><ul><li>BL-5K 1200 mAh Li-Ion battery<\/li><li>ACP-12U 5.7V 800mA AC adapter<\/li><li>Talk time (maximum): <ul><li>GSM 6.9 h<\/li><li>WCDMA 4.5 h<\/li><li>VoIP 6 h<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Standby time (maximum): <ul><li>GSM 363 h<\/li><li>WCDMA 363 h<\/li><li>WLAN 172 h<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Browsing time with packet data (maximum): 5 h 42 min<\/li><li>Video playback time (maximum): 7 h<\/li><li>Video recording time (maximum): 2 h 54 min<\/li><li>Video call time (maximum): 2 h 42 min<\/li><li>Gaming time (maximum): 7 h<\/li><\/ul><h3>Operating Frequency<\/h3><ul><li>Quad-band EGSM 850\/900\/1800\/1900<\/li><li>WCDMA 2100\/1900\/850 (in the Americas) and 2100\/1900\/900 (everywhere else)<\/li><li>Automatic switching between WCDMA\/GSM bands<\/li><li>Flight mode<\/li><\/ul><h3>Connectivity<\/h3><ul><li>Bluetooth version 2.0 with Enhanced Data Rate.<\/li><li>Bluetooth profiles: <ul><li>Dial Up Networking Profile (Gateway)<\/li><li>Object Push Profile (Server and Client)<\/li><li>File Transfer Profile (Server)<\/li><li>Hands Free Profile (Audio Gateway)<\/li><li>Headset Profile (Audio Gateway)<\/li><li>Basic Imaging Profile (Image Push Responder and Initiator)<\/li><li>Remote SIM Access Profile (Server)<\/li><li>Device Identification Profile<\/li><li>Phone Book Access Profile (Server)<\/li><li>Stereo Audio Streaming:<\/li><li>Generic Audio\/Video Distribution Profile<\/li><li>Audio\/Video Remote Control Profile (A\/V Remote Control Target)<\/li><li>Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (Audio Source)<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Add-on solutions enable integration into enterprise private branch exchange (PBX) infrastructure<\/li><li>DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) certification<\/li><li>UPnP support<\/li><li>MTP (Mobile Transfer Protocol) support<\/li><li>TV out (PAL) with Nokia Video Connectivity Cable (CA-75U, in box inclusion may vary based on sales package configuration)<\/li><li>Nokia XpressPrint<\/li><li>Support for local and remote SyncML synchronization<\/li><\/ul>",

It was the most successful computer platform in Japan and one of the best-selling computer systems of the 20th century. It has a very large video game library with thousands of titles, the majority of which were never released outside Japan.",
            "description": "<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>PC-98 is a series of 16\/32-bit Japanese <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">personal computers<\/a>, designed by <a href=\"\/nec-home-electronics-ltd\/3010-2708\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2708\">NEC<\/a>, but also licensed to other companies. In contrast to its <a href=\"\/nec-pc-8801\/3045-109\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-109\">PC-88<\/a> predecessor, the PC-98 was initially created as a business machine, but over time it eventually became popular with game developers. The PC-98 is based around Intel 8086 and compatible processors, but the design is proprietary, and it is not compatible with the <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">IBM PC<\/a> or clones, although versions of DOS and Windows were ported to it.<\/p><p>The system has a very large library of video games, consisting of more than 4,000 commercial titles and countless more <a href=\"\/indie\/3015-2911\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2911\">doujin<\/a> (<a href=\"\/indie\/3015-2911\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2911\">indie<\/a>) titles. The games and system are difficult to find outside of Japan, even on eBay. There are a few sites however that sell the games and systems.<\/p><h2>History<\/h2><p>When the PC-98 was launched in 1982, it was initially priced at \u00a5298,000 (about $1400 in 1982 dollars, equivalent to about $3400 in 2012 dollars). The PC-98 computer platform eventually went on to sell more than 18 million units in <a href=\"\/japan\/3035-37\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan<\/a> by 1999, surpassing the <a href=\"\/commodore-64\/3045-14\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64<\/a> (17 million units) as the best-selling home computer system of the 20th century.<\/p><p><a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">Laptop<\/a> versions of the PC-9801 were also being sold in the late 1980s. The first was the PC-98 LT, one of the first mass-market laptops, released in 1986. It is considered the world's first major <a href=\"http:\/\/www.computerandvideogames.com\/399405\/features\/history-lesson-turbografx-pc-engine\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">laptop PC<\/a>. The world's first notebook computer was released in 1989, NEC's UltraLite. By 1990, the 32-bit PC-9801 NC model became the world's first laptop\/notebook computer with a colour TFT LCD display.<\/p><h3>NEC APC and rivalry with IBM PC overseas<\/h3><p>In the early 1980's, the PC-9801 was more advanced than Western computer platforms. The PC-98 featured the first dedicated computer GPU chip, the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NEC_%C2%B5PD7220\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">NEC 7220 GDC<\/a>, along with a 16-bit NEC CPU. It featured higher VGA display resolutions (initially up to 640x475 pixels, then up to 1024x1024 in 1983, and then up to 1120x750 pixels by 1985) in order to more accurately display Japanese text, a wider <a href=\"http:\/\/books.google.co.uk\/books?id=_C8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA33\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">color palette<\/a> (16 colors displayed out of a 4096 color palette), Yamaha <a href=\"\/chiptune\/3015-3745\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3745\">FM synthesis<\/a> sound chips for higher-quality audio, and a modem for <a href=\"\/online\/3015-559\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-559\">online<\/a> internet access.<\/p><p>NEC attempted to introduce the NEC PC-9801 in <a href=\"\/north-america\/3035-1664\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1664\">North America<\/a>, where it was re-branded as the NEC APC in 1982. NEC, the largest semiconductor company of the 1980s, marketed the APC III as the most powerful computer on the market and more reliable machine than leading competitor <a href=\"\/ibm\/3010-190\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-190\">IBM<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC <\/a>platform, with the APC III offering twice as much speed (8 MHz), storage (720 KB floppy disks) and resolution (640x400 pixels) at around the same price. Despite the superior hardware compared to its competitors, the APC III eventually failed to make in impact in North America, largely due to the rise of IBM PC clones, which also negatively impacted IBM's share of the North American PC market.<\/p><p>While the NEC APC was unsuccessful in North America, it became successful in the <a href=\"\/asia\/3035-1663\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1663\">Asia<\/a>-Pacific region, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.old-computers.com\/museum\/computer.asp?c=333\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">particularly<\/a> in <a href=\"\/australia\/3035-292\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-292\">Australia<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Rivalry with Sharp X68000 and FM Towns in Japan<\/h3><p>The PC-98 was later technically surpassed by fellow Japanese rivals <a href=\"\/sharp-corporation\/3010-6509\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6509\">Sharp<\/a> and <a href=\"\/fujitsu\/3010-6596\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6596\">Fujitsu <\/a>when they launched their own more powerful 16\/32-bit computers, the <a href=\"\/sharp-x68000\/3045-95\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-95\">Sharp X68000<\/a> and <a href=\"\/fm-towns\/3045-108\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-108\">FM Towns<\/a>, in 1987 and 1989, respectively.<\/p><p>In response, the PC-98 began using 32-bit Intel CPU processors from 1987 and supported the CD-ROM format from 1989. While both rival computers were capable of more advanced, <a href=\"\/arcade\/3045-84\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade<\/a> quality graphics (especially in the X68000's case) and\/or greater multimedia features (in the FM Towns' case), neither computer platform was able to dethrone the PC-98 as the Japanese computer market leader.<\/p><h3>3D graphics cards and rivaly with IBM-compatible PC's in Japan<\/h3><p>Just as <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">IBM-compatible PC's<\/a> were on the rise in the mid-1990s, <a href=\"\/nec-home-electronics-ltd\/3010-2708\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2708\">NEC <\/a>came back by releasing the first <a href=\"\/polygonal-3d\/3015-1430\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">3D graphics<\/a> accelerator cards on the market, initially for the PC-98. In 1995, NEC released the first 3D graphics card, the PC-FXGA (PC-FX Game Accelerator), exclusively for the PC-98. This allowed the PC-98 to produce the most advanced <a href=\"\/polygonal-3d\/3015-1430\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">3D graphics<\/a> seen on a home system up until that time, with a polygon rendering performance surpassing the <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation<\/a> console and even rivaling the then upcoming <a href=\"\/nintendo-64\/3045-43\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64<\/a>; in contrast, rival early 1996 3D graphics accelerators for IBM PC clones, such as Creative Labs' 3D Blaster and <a href=\"\/nvidia-corporation\/3010-6345\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6345\">NVIDIA<\/a>'s NV1, were unable to rival the PlayStation's 3D graphics. The PC-FXGA was originally intended for both the PC-98 computer and the <a href=\"\/pc-fx\/3045-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-75\">PC-FX<\/a> console, with as a <a href=\"\/homebrew\/3015-4363\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4363\">homebrew <\/a>development kit for the <a href=\"\/pc-fx\/3045-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-75\">PC-FX<\/a> console, allowing the PC-98 to play PC-FX games. However, the PC-FX console lacked the 3D graphical capabilities of the PC-FXGA card, due to the FXGA's HuC6273 graphics chip (originally intended for the PC-FX) never actually being used by the PC-FX console.<\/p><p>The PC-FXGA was the most powerful 3D graphics card on the market up until it was surpassed by NEC's successor, the PowerVR, in early 1996. Unlike the PC-FXGA, the succeeding PowerVR was no longer exclusive to the PC-98, but supported both the PC-98 and IBM-compatible PC's. The PowerVR was able to produce near <a href=\"\/arcade\/3045-84\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade<\/a> quality 3D graphics, demonstrated by a near arcade quality port of <a href=\"\/namco\/3010-7420\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7420\">Namco<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/rave-racer\/3030-23244\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23244\">Rave Racer<\/a>, though this PowerVR port was later cancelled. The PowerVR would not be rivaled until the arrival of the 3dfx Voodoo graphics card for IBM-compatible PC's in late 1996. Though both the PowerVR and Voodoo were more or less evenly matched when it came to 3D capabilities, it was the Voodoo that became the most popular graphics card line-up of the late 1990s, due to the PowerVR's lack of third-party software support. Besides the PowerVR, the PC-98 very few other 3D graphics cards supported the PC-98.<\/p><h3>Decline<\/h3><p>The PC-98 would continue to dominate the Japanese computer market until the late 1990s, when the arrival of <a href=\"\/microsoft-studios\/3010-340\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft <\/a>Windows 95 made it possible for <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">IBM-compatible PC's<\/a> to accurately output Japanese text, leading to the rise of IBM-compatible PC's in Japan and marking the end of the 'Golden Age' of Japanese computer gaming.<\/p><p>By the end of the 1990s, the PC-98's dwindling market share as well as NEC's greater support for the growing IBM PC market eventually led to the PC-98 slowly losing ground to IBM-compatible PC's. In 1997, the PC-98 NX became one of the first computer platforms produced in line with the PC97 System Design Guide standard, which would later become the worldwide standard for IBM-compatible PC's. As a result, PC-98 standards eventually merged with IBM-compatible PC standards, bringing an end to the traditional PC-98 platform by the early 2000s, succeeded by IBM-compatible PC-98 NX computers which are still manufactured through to the present day.<\/p><h2>Technical specifications<\/h2><h3><strong>Main processors<\/strong><\/h3><p><strong>Main CPU (Central Processing Unit)

It decided to differentiate the Neo Geo from its competitors by bringing arcade-quality graphics into living rooms. Marketing was heavily geared towards making it a gaming connoisseur's console, and it was even couched as a 24-bit system.<\/p><p>The Neo Geo used a Motorola 68000, a hybrid 16\/32-bit CPU, along with the Zilog Z80, an 8-bit CPU, much like <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/genesis\/3045-6\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Mega Drive\/Genesis<\/a> console. The difference in bits was that the Neo Geo had a 24-bit GPU chipset, hence the \"24-bit\" marketing label (much like how the <a href=\"\/turbografx-16\/3045-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-55\">TurboGrafx-16<\/a> was labelled \"16-bit\" because of its 16-bit GPU chipset).<\/p><p>Much of the Neo Geo's advanced graphical capabilities, however, came from the use of custom GPU graphics processors, both within the system as well as additional chips on individual game cartridges, much like an arcade machine. The Neo Geo featured up to seven specialized processors, including the two CPU processors and several graphics chips. And while the RAM was not very large, it could access larger ROM data directly from cartridges at high speeds. These features made the Neo Geo the most powerful home gaming system at the time of its release in 1990, rivalled only by the <a href=\"\/sharp-x68000\/3045-95\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-95\">Sharp X68000<\/a> home <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">computer<\/a> (which also used custom GPU graphics processors).

It allowed arcade operators to save on much-needed space by having a single cabinet have multiple games. The MVS came in two, four, and six slot systems; these would allow gamers to pick which game they wanted at the title screen. The control options were the same as the AES four-button system, the only difference being the controls were mounted to cabinet. A key difference between MVS and AES were the cartridges: a MVS cart will not work in an AES, and vice-versa. The goal behind this incompatibility was to deter arcade operators from buying the cheaper AES cartridges. The MVS carts from did not come with colorful artwork or plastic boxes like their home counterparts; they would often come in plain cardboard boxes with only a marquee slip or flyer.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1676408-japanese_arcade.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676408\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.67\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1676408-japanese_arcade.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676408\"><img alt=\"Candy Cabs lined up at a Japanese arcade\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/121177\/1676408-japanese_arcade.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1676408-japanese_arcade.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/121177\/1676408-japanese_arcade.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Candy Cabs lined up at a Japanese arcade\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/121177\/1676408-japanese_arcade.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1676408-japanese_arcade.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/121177\/1676408-japanese_arcade.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Candy Cabs lined up at a Japanese arcade<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Candy Cabs are Japanese sit down cabinets that SNK used for their MVS machines inside Japanese arcades.

The North American cabinets would normally have HAPP brand buttons, and a bat-top joystick.<\/p><h2>Advanced Entertainment System<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1675120-neo_geo_games.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1675120\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1675120-neo_geo_games.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1675120\"><img alt=\"Typical AES packaging with games\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1675120-neo_geo_games.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1675120-neo_geo_games.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Typical AES packaging with games\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1675120-neo_geo_games.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1675120-neo_geo_games.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Typical AES packaging with games<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>AES (Advanced Entertainment System) is the term used for describing the home platform of the Neo Geo system, as opposed to the arcade or MVS (Multi Video system) version. The term has since become slang to describe AES cartridges themselves, However the proper name for a AES Neo Geo game is NGH. The way to tell an NGH cartridge from its arcade counterpart is the large colorful artwork featured on the home carts. Arcade cartridges had no branding or consumer packaging because they were hidden inside the machines.<\/p><p>Before the AES was made commercially available it was only sold to larger video rental stores who would in turn rent the system out. This was an unusual practice for a video game platform, and was speculated that this was SNK testing the waters for mass consumption.<\/p><h2>Neo Geo Memory Card<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1696917-2046880692_2a897278f8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1696917\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"375\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 375px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1696917-2046880692_2a897278f8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1696917\"><img alt=\"Neo Geo Memory Card\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1696917-2046880692_2a897278f8.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1696917-2046880692_2a897278f8.jpg 375w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Neo Geo Memory Card\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1696917-2046880692_2a897278f8.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121177\/1696917-2046880692_2a897278f8.jpg 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Neo Geo Memory Card<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Neo Geo system was the first platform to use a removable memory card.

Unlike more popular CD systems at the time thie Neo Geo CD only contained a single speed CD drive, this meant that load times on some games, could be between three to five minutes. While for some systems this would be a burden the fact that the platform was almost exclusively made for fast action arcade experienced this became a much more severe problem for SNK. Fighting games for instance would often load between each round, when compared to it's cartridge counterparts this made the games seemed like lesser products.<\/p><p>In 1995 the Neo Geo CD underwent a redesign, and was renamed the Neo Geo CDZ. It had much of the same hardware, but with a dual-speed CD drive and a larger memory cache. This reduced load times for CD-based games. There was only a very limited run of Neo Geo CDZ's in Japan; no North American or European versions where made.<\/p><h2>High Price Point<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/48409\/1652434-biggerbadderbetter.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1652434\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3666666666667\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:136.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/48409\/1652434-biggerbadderbetter.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1652434\"><img alt=\"The \"24-bit\" marketing\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" data-width=\"468\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/48409\/1652434-biggerbadderbetter.gif\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/4\/48409\/1652434-biggerbadderbetter.gif 450w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The \"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The \"24-bit\" marketing<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Neo Geo AES was a notoriously expensive console, costing $650 at launch. There was little effort to emulate or adapt MVS hardware builds for home entertainment use, so cartridges costed as much as existing arcade cabinets ($100-$300). The console failed to gain market share because of these prohibitive costs, although it gained a cult following amongst its targeted demographic of gaming aficionados. The console lost what market share it had earned among enthusiasts by refusing to innovate or improve the system when its competitors did, especially when it did not make the jump to the 32-bit 5th generation of consoles in the late 90s.<\/p><p>Efforts to make its games more accessible by porting some of the console's exclusives to specialized arcade cabinets enjoyed limited success, but the console could still not compete with its competitors' price cuts and more extensive game libraries. The increased access to the Neo Geo's library did however cement SNK's reputation as a developer of solid fighting games, fueling its success for the rest of the 90's with hits like the <a href=\"\/king-of-fighters\/3025-407\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-407\">King of Fighters<\/a> franchise.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8153\/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-924841\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.63651050080775\" data-width=\"619\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 619px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8153\/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-924841\"><img alt=\"AES Console with 2 controllers and library of games.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8153\/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8153\/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2.jpg 619w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/8153\/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8153\/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"AES Console with 2 controllers and library of games.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8153\/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8153\/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2.jpg 619w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/8153\/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8153\/924841-90_neo_geo_aes_general2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>AES Console with 2 controllers and library of games.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The console itself ceased manufacture in 1997, but games for the console would continue to be made and released in arcades, mainly in <a href=\"\/japan\/3035-37\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan<\/a>.

The system's high price point at launch coupled with the fact that games could be hundreds of dollars new meant that most people's libraries of games stayed small. This lead to obscure or popular games becoming more valuable and difficult to track down. For example, the popular AES game <a href=\"\/metal-slug-super-vehicle-001\/3030-6941\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6941\">Metal Slug<\/a> regularly sells at auctions for eight hundred to two thousand US dollars.

Rather the Neo Geo CD was an attempt by SNK to correct it's biggest hurtle to entry for adopters of the original <a href=\"\/neo-geo\/3045-25\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-25\">Neo Geo<\/a>, the price of games. Carts for the original Neo Geo system were exactly the same as their arcade counterpart, this meant that they were a higher quality than most console games, but it also meant that they cost a lot more, new releases for the system regularly retailed for $100-$300 upon release. With the new CD format SNK could release home conversions of their arcade releases for a more reasonable price point at about $50-$60. Unfortunately, the Neo Geo CD had it's own problems, most notably load times that regularly lasted several minutes. Most of the systems library consisted of Neo-Geo ports with only a small library of games like <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/ironclad\/3030-30585\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30585\">Ironclad<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/crossed-swords-ii\/3030-40322\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-40322\">Crossed swords II<\/a> and <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/shinsetsu-samurai-spirits-bushidou-retsuden\/3030-33695\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-33695\">Samurai Shodown RPG<\/a> being exclusive Neo-Geo CD releases.<\/p><h2><b>Technical specifications<\/b><\/h2><ul><li>Processor: Motorola 68000 running at 12 MHz<\/li><li>Co-Processor: Zilog Z80 running at 4 MHz<\/li><li>Colors On Screen: 4,096<\/li><li>Colors Available: 65,536<\/li><li>Resolution: 304 x 224<\/li><li>Max Sprites: 380<\/li><li>Max Sprite Size: 16 x 512<\/li><li>Number of Planes: 3<\/li><\/ul><p> <\/p><p>RAM specifications:<\/p><ul><li>68000 Program Memory: 2 MB<\/li><li>Fix Layer Memory: 128 KB<\/li><li>Graphics Memory: 4 MB<\/li><li>Sound Sample Memory: 1 MB<\/li><li>Z80 Program Memory: 64 kB<\/li><li>VRAM: 512Kb (For graphics attributes)<\/li><li>SRAM: 2 KB (For high scores \/ general save data)<\/li><\/ul><p> <\/p>",

The handheld was released on March 16, 1999 in Japan and on August 6, 1999 in North America. The system was released exclusively on the online retailer eToys in North America for a retail price of $69.95. eToys also had six launch titles. The Neo Geo Pocket Color had six colors available at launch: Camouflage Blue, Carbon Black, Crystal White, Platinum Blue, Platinum Silver, and Stone Blue. The Neo Geo Pocket Color was later released in other major retailers.<\/p><p>After SNK was bought out by Aruze, they tried to make the console exclusive to the Asian market, by recalling consoles and games (they would be re-sold in Asia). Later in 2003, the back-stock of the North American systems and software began to appear on the market. These consoles came with six games (with no case or manual), including <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22465\" href=\"\/faselei\/3030-22465\/\" slug=\"faselei\">Faselei!<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17678\" href=\"\/the-last-blade\/3030-17678\/\" slug=\"the-last-blade\">Last Blade<\/a> (neither of which were released in North America).

It is not easily accessible next to the game card slot at the bottom side of the lower half, safely hidden behind a cover flap (similar to the design of the card slot on the <a href=\"\/nintendo-switch\/3045-157\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-157\">Nintendo Switch<\/a>).<\/p><p>New Nintendo 2DS XL will release first in Australia and New Zealand when it launches on June 15, 2017 for AU$199.95.

The <a href=\"\/stereoscopic-3d\/3015-1204\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1204\">concept of 3D<\/a> intrigued them, and they continued experimenting ways to make it a serious way to play over the next 20 years. For every single new console they have made, they have tried to introduce some sort of 3D functionality. Most of these attempts weren't announced due to they not being up to their standards, especially after the commercial flop of the <a href=\"\/virtual-boy\/3045-79\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-79\">Virtual Boy<\/a> in 1995.<\/p><p>It wasn't until it came time to create the successor to the Nintendo DS that they found a way to utilize it. The 3DS did not actually begin development as a 3D focused console, but instead it was just meant to be a successor to the DS with next-gen graphics, which Miyamoto called \"the typical evolution of a game device.\" However, without a good 'hook' to justify the release of a new console when the DS and its revisions were becoming the most popular game systems ever made, the system was pushed back until they felt it was appropriate.<\/p><p>Miyamoto and Iwata wanted to include 3D in this new console, but they had to make sure it was there from the outset, and not released as an add-on peripheral to the device in order to increase the audience for it from the beginning. By the time the 3DS was being planned, LCD devices that could output autostereostopic images (where 3D images can be displayed without the need for <a href=\"\/3-d-glasses\/3055-1919\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1919\">3D glasses<\/a>) were already in development, and Nintendo decided to be one of the first to try the technology out.<\/p><p>The developers at Nintendo were astonished by the new technology, with Miyamoto calling it the same feeling when he saw <a href=\"\/yoshi\/3005-700\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-700\">Yoshi<\/a> first appear on the 16-bit screen of the <a href=\"\/game-boy-advance\/3045-4\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance<\/a> back during its development. Miyamoto also said it alleviates many of the harder parts of developing 3D games, especially Mario games, where a lot of effort has to be made to make the three-dimensional world that Mario traverses to be easily interpreted by the player.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2164\/1408420-7074_3ds_slider_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1408420\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2164\/1408420-7074_3ds_slider_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1408420\"><img alt=\"The 3D slider.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/2164\/1408420-7074_3ds_slider_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2164\/1408420-7074_3ds_slider_super.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/2164\/1408420-7074_3ds_slider_super.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The 3D slider.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/2164\/1408420-7074_3ds_slider_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2164\/1408420-7074_3ds_slider_super.jpg 600w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/2164\/1408420-7074_3ds_slider_super.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The 3D slider.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>According to him, they had to use many tricks to make it easy for the player to hit a floating '?' block in previous 3D Mario games, but when they experimented on the 3DS, it became very natural. He said it was the perfect time to bring back their previous franchises that started out in 3D to the 3DS, because it would allow him to create easier to play, yet more difficult sequels to the original games.<\/p><p>To Iwata, the 3DS is a means to bring 3D from being 'about impact', to being 'about depth', to be a serious part of the gameplay and the experience, instead of a simple gimmick. The 3D slider on the 3DS was created by request of Miyamoto and his engineers to have all kinds of people be able to enjoy the 3D graphics without experiencing double vision of blurry images due to their unique spacing between eyes, which has been in problem with many 3D movies, where the 3D is already set to a pre-set certain focus.<\/p><h2>3D and Graphical Capabilities<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9589\/1469974-3ds_topscreen_new_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1469974\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"2.8179894179894\" data-width=\"945\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 945px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:281.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9589\/1469974-3ds_topscreen_new_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1469974\"><img alt=\"An illustration showing how the 3D screen works.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\" data-width=\"340\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9589\/1469974-3ds_topscreen_new_1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9589\/1469974-3ds_topscreen_new_1_.jpg 945w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/9589\/1469974-3ds_topscreen_new_1_.jpg 681w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9589\/1469974-3ds_topscreen_new_1_.jpg 340w\"><noscript><img alt=\"An illustration showing how the 3D screen works.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9589\/1469974-3ds_topscreen_new_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9589\/1469974-3ds_topscreen_new_1_.jpg 945w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/9589\/1469974-3ds_topscreen_new_1_.jpg 681w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9589\/1469974-3ds_topscreen_new_1_.jpg 340w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\" data-width=\"340\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>An illustration showing how the 3D screen works.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Unlike other 3D equipment, the 3DS does not require the use of 3D glasses. This is due to its auto-stereostopic ( <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Parallax_barrier\" rel=\"nofollow\">parallax barrier<\/a>) screen, capable of showing two different viewpoints of the same image at the same time. The screen has twice the horizontal pixel density of any other screen, which allows one set of lines aimed at one eye, while the other set is aimed at the other. The 3DS renders a single frame twice, each a different viewpoint, interlaced between each other vertically. Because of this, each eye will see a different frame, and your brain puts both of the frames together as a 3D image.<\/p><p>This results in the game actually running at half the frame rate that it's running internally; to make a 60 fps game on the 3DS, the developer would need to be able to make it run at 120 fps in 2D. However, this does not take up half the power of the console, which is just an urban myth. Several games support two different framerates: 60fps in 2D mode and 30fps in 3D mode while a select few manage to run at 60fps in 3D mode such as <a href=\"\/mario-kart-7\/3030-31747\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31747\">Mario Kart 7<\/a> and <a href=\"\/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds\/3030-42402\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42402\">The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds<\/a>. This shows the advanced power of the hardware, which is capable of rendering high end shaders, lighting, shadows, textures, fur, bump mapping, normal mapping, and other effects in real time with ease.<\/p><h2>Other Features<\/h2><p>Available on the 3DS eshop is a virtual console library which includes Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Gear, and NES games.<\/p><p>The 3DS supports <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joystiq.com\/2010\/09\/29\/nintendo-reveals-more-3ds-hardware-details-os-features\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miis<\/a>, including a Mii Maker feature that allows the 3DS to take a picture of the user or someone in the vicinity such as a friend or family member to use as a guide for Mii creation.<\/p><p>Other built in software includes:<\/p><ul><li><b>Nintendo 3DS Camera<\/b> - similar to DSi Camera, but with more features - including the ability to take pictures in 3D using the dual camera lenses on the system's top shell. Also supports the scanning of QR codes.<\/li><li><b>Nintendo 3DS Sound<\/b> - Audio playback application similar to DSi Sound with support for mp3 and AAC types with .m4a, .mp4 and .3gp extensions.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/streetpass-mii-plaza\/3030-34857\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34857\"><b>StreetPass Mii Plaza<\/b><\/a> - A version of the Mii Plaza which shows the Miis of other 3DS users encountered in StreetPass Mode (See below) and allows for their use in small games like Find Mii (A small RPG) and a Puzzle Game<\/li><li><a href=\"\/face-raiders\/3030-34610\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34610\"><b>Face Raiders<\/b><\/a> - An <a href=\"\/augmented-reality\/3015-3225\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3225\">Augmented Reality<\/a> Game where photos of the user or friends are placed onto balloons which fly around the environment as the player attempts to shoot them<\/li><li><b>AR Games<\/b> - An app which interacts with the bundled AR Games cards to provide access to various Augmented Reality functions such as placing 3D models of characters such as Mario in the environment or playing a number of advanced AR Games<\/li><li><b>Activity Log<\/b> - Functions similarly to the feature seen on the Wii's Message Board, but is more advanced. In addition to game playing time, also tracks steps with the built-in pedometer (And therefore allows players to earn Coins, a system-level pervasive currency which can be used to unlock content in games) amongst other things<\/li><li><b>Game Notes<\/b> - By pressing the Home Button, the player can pause the game and use this system app to write things down using the touchscreen.<\/li><li><b>Notifications<\/b> - Notifies users of things like StreetPass Data having been shared or new <a href=\"\/spotpass\/3015-7202\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7202\">SpotPass<\/a> data being downloaded<\/li><li><a href=\"\/download-play\/3015-2407\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2407\"><b>Download Play<\/b><\/a> - Allows players to partake in single-card Multiplayer Games from those games which support this feature (Such as <a href=\"\/super-street-fighter-iv\/3030-28437\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28437\">Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition<\/a>)<\/li><li><b>Friends List <\/b>- While it still uses a variation of the heavily criticized friend code system, players only need to register one single friend code which works on a system wide level instead of codes for every single title like on older systems, making the process far easier than before. It is also possible to directly join a friend's multiplayer session via the \"join game\" button in the friend list.<\/li><li><strong>Web Browser<\/strong> - A web browser that can run while a game is suspended in the background, letting players browse the web for tips, etc if they're stuck in a game.<\/li><li><strong>Miiverse<\/strong> - Nintendo's social \"empathy\" network made its way onto the 3DS via a firmware update in December 2013. It lets the 3DS access the service's features for games with communities on Miiverse and post drawings, text and (if supported) screenshots from the game. However, the 3DS version of Miiverse does not support messaging between friends.<\/li><\/ul><h2>StreetPass<\/h2><p>StreetPass is a functionality built in to the 3DS. If multiple 3DS systems which are powered on or in sleep mode were to come within a certain range of one another, they share data. This data includes the Mii data built-in to the system as part of the 'StreetPass Mii Plaza', allowing them to trade puzzle pieces or fight in the RPG mini-game 'Find Mii'. The feature is also supported by games. Users can choose to opt-in to <a href=\"\/streetpass-functionality\/3015-6609\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6609\">StreetPass functionality<\/a> for individual games. A bit of saved data then appears system-level to share it (so you don't need to be in sleep mode within the chosen software). A 3DS system is able to have up to 12 Apps\/Games having StreetPass enabled at a time.<\/p><h2>SpotPass<\/h2><p><a href=\"\/spotpass\/3015-7202\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7202\">SpotPass<\/a> is the ability for the 3DS to seek Wi-Fi signals and automatically download content while in sleep mode. This allows games and the system itself to download updates and share data such as leader-board scores in a whisper-net like manner, free from user input.<\/p><h2>Launch Titles<\/h2><h4>Japan launch titles:<\/h4><ul><li><a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/combat-of-giants-dinosaurs-3d\/3030-31766\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31766\">Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3D<\/a><\/li><li>Nintendogs + Cats<\/li><li>Professor Layton and the Mask of Miracle<\/li><li>Puzzle Bobble 3D<\/li><li>Ridge Racer 3D<\/li><li>Samurai Warriors Chronicle<\/li><li>Super Street Fighter IV 3D<\/li><li><a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/pro-evolution-soccer-2011\/3030-31217\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31217\">Winning Eleven 3D Soccer<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h4>USA launch titles:<\/h4><ul><li>Asphalt 3D<\/li><li>Bust-a-Move Universe<\/li><li>Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs 3D<\/li><li>LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars<\/li><li>Madden NFL Football<\/li><li>Nintendogs + Cats<\/li><li>Pilotwings Resort<\/li><li>Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 3D<\/li><li>Rayman 3D<\/li><li>Ridge Racer 3D<\/li><li>Samurai Warriors: Chronicles<\/li><li>The Sims 3<\/li><li>Steel Diver<\/li><li>Super Monkey Ball 3D<\/li><li>Super Street Fighter IV 3D<\/li><li>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars<\/li><\/ul><h4>Europe launch titles:<\/h4><ul><li><a href=\"\/asphalt-3d\/3030-34244\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34244\">Asphalt 3D<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/lego-star-wars-iii-the-clone-wars\/3030-29992\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29992\">LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/nintendogs-cats\/3030-31736\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31736\">Nintendogs + Cats<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/pilotwings-resort\/3030-31748\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31748\">Pilotwings Resort<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/pro-evolution-soccer-2011\/3030-31217\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31217\">Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 3D<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/rayman-2-the-great-escape\/3030-609\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-609\">Rayman 3D<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/ridge-racer-3d\/3030-31741\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31741\">Ridge Racer 3D<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/samurai-warriors-chronicles\/3030-31763\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31763\">Samurai Warriors: Chronicles<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/the-sims-3\/3030-20581\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20581\">The Sims 3<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/super-monkey-ball-3d\/3030-32814\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-32814\">Super Monkey Ball 3D<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/super-street-fighter-iv\/3030-28437\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28437\">Super Street Fighter IV 3D<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-shadow-wars\/3030-31771\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31771\">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"\/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-chaos-theory\/3030-12354\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12354\">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3D<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h2>Nintendo 3DS Colors<\/h2><table><thead><tr><th>Model \/ Color<\/th><th>Japan<\/th><th>North America<\/th><th>Europe<\/th><th>Australia<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Cosmo Black<\/td><td>February 26, 2011 (disc.)<\/td><td>March 27, 2011<\/td><td>March 25, 2011<\/td><td>March 31, 2011<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Aqua Blue<\/td><td>February 26, 2011 (disc.)<\/td><td>March 27, 2011<\/td><td>March 25, 2011<\/td><td>March 31, 2011<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Flare (JP)\/Flame (US)\/Metallic Red (EU)<\/td><td>July 14, 2011<\/td><td>September 9, 2011<\/td><td>September 30, 2011<\/td><td>September 22, 2011<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Misty\/Pearl\/Coral\/Lavender Pink<\/td><td>October 20, 2011<\/td><td>December 4, 2011<\/td><td>December 16, 2011<\/td><td>November 17, 2011<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ice White<\/td><td>November 3, 2011 (disc.)<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>November 17, 2011<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cobalt Blue<\/td><td>March 22, 2012<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Midnight Purple<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>May 20, 2012<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Light Blue<\/td><td>March 20, 2013<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gloss Pink<\/td><td>March 20, 2013<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Metallic Red (JP)<\/td><td>June 13, 2013<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clear Black<\/td><td>October 10, 2013<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pure White<\/td><td>October 10, 2013<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><td>-<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><ul><li>On May 11th, 2012, Nintendo Japan announced that Aqua Blue would be ending production in that territory.<\/li><li>On September 13, 2013, Nintendo Japan announced that the Cosmo Black launch model and the Ice White model are also being discontinued.

The 3DSs served as a replacement of the museum's previous audio guides that had become outdated. The 3DS serves both as a map and an audio tour. It contains over 35 hours of dialog in several different languages explaining the different works of art in the museum. It has since been released as <a href=\"\/nintendo-3ds-guide-louvre\/3030-44789\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-44789\">a fully featured product on the eShop<\/a> and was even made available in physical retail format exclusively at the Louvre's gift shop.<\/p><p>The Louvre\u2019s managing director Herv\u00e9 Barbaret had this to say about the use of the 3DS at the Louvre<\/p><blockquote><p>Through this partnership, we wanted to bring together heritage and the innovative world of interactive entertainment through a system many people are already familiar with. We feel that the Nintendo 3DS is perfect to achieve this goal... we believe that the new audio guide is a valuable tool that will help visiting the Louvre a more dynamic and rewarding experience, particularly for those that are not so familiar with a museum environment.<\/p><\/blockquote>",

By connecting to the eShop by August 12, 3DS owners were eligible to receive 20 free games on the Nintendo eShop, 10 <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"\/nes\/3045-21\/\">NES<\/a> games and 10 <a data-ref-id=\"3045-4\" href=\"\/game-boy-advance\/3045-4\/\">Game Boy Advance<\/a> games. Nintendo initially stated to have no plans to release the Game Boy Avance games for sale.<\/p><p>These games do not have added 3D capability and the NES versions were incomplete when released on September 1st with updates to arrive at later points (coinciding with the respective game's official eShop debut). Ambassadors are able to download updated versions of the NES games at no extra charge.

As its name suggests, the console is designed around a 64-bit CPU based on the <a href=\"\/mips\/3005-16012\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16012\">MIPS<\/a> processor architecture owned by Silicon Graphics, Inc., marking the first occurrence of a high-performance computing manufacturer like SGI developing technology for a major game console marketed to the general public. The N64's hardware was built to display <a href=\"\/polygonal-3d\/3015-1430\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">polygonal 3D<\/a> graphics natively; this meant a substantial boost in processing power over its predecessor, the <a href=\"\/super-nintendo-entertainment-system\/3045-9\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System<\/a>, which required additional co-processors like the <a href=\"\/super-fx-chip\/3015-7544\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7544\">Super FX chip<\/a> for polygons.<\/p><p>Like Nintendo's previous home consoles, the N64 uses <a href=\"\/game-cartridge\/3055-6085\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-6085\">cartridges<\/a> as its software medium. This was in contrast to its two main competitors, the <a href=\"\/sony-corporation\/3010-3223\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3223\">Sony<\/a> <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega<\/a> <a href=\"\/saturn\/3045-42\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-42\">Saturn<\/a>, both of which used less-expensive <a href=\"\/compact-disc\/3055-2133\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2133\">compact disc<\/a>-based media. Although Nintendo 64 games avoided the lengthier load times associated with discs, the decision to use cartridges also meant higher manufacturing costs for game publishers, leading to reduced third-party software support for the N64 over its lifespan.<\/p><h2>History<\/h2><h3>Development<\/h3><p>Alhough Nintendo had dominated the Japanese and North American home console markets during the late 1980s with its highly successful <a href=\"\/nintendo-entertainment-system\/3045-21\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Nintendo Entertainment System<\/a>, serious competition from hardware rivals such as <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega<\/a> coupled with a national Japanese recession beginning in the early 1990s contributed to comparatively reduced sales figures for Nintendo's 16-bit <a href=\"\/super-nintendo-entertainment-system\/3045-9\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES<\/a>. With the subsequent rise of <a href=\"\/polygonal-3d\/3015-1430\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">polygonal 3D<\/a> graphics and the appearance of relative industry newcomers such as <a href=\"\/sony-corporation\/3010-3223\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3223\">Sony<\/a>, Nintendo was in danger of losing a much greater portion of their market share without a proper successor to the SNES.<\/p><p>Silicon Graphics, Inc., a prominent developer of high-performance workstations and graphics applications, had approached Sega in the early 1990s with an offer to develop technology for a powerful next-generation gaming console, but this deal never materialized. After their initial proposal with Sega fell through, SGI successfully approached Nintendo instead, leading to Nintendo and SGI publicly announcing a partnership in August 1993 to co-develop \"Project Reality\" as Nintendo's next home system. The initial projection was that the as-of-yet-unnamed console would be available in stores \"by late 1995...below $250\". The culmination of SGI's contribution to this venture was the R4300i microprocessor, a chip developed by SGI's recently acquired subsidiary <a href=\"\/mips\/3005-16012\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16012\">MIPS<\/a> Technologies and designed for use in Nintendo's next console. The R4300i was also used in Project Reality software development kits sold as premium-priced \"SGI Onyx\" systems, which allowed Nintendo's select partner developers to prototype games for their upcoming console before its retail hardware specifications were finalized.<\/p><p>The new system's external design and name were first revealed publicly in a June 1994 press release depicting a curved black console emblazoned with a \"Nintendo Ultra 64\" logo and featuring a generic ROM <a href=\"\/game-cartridge\/3055-6085\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-6085\">cartridge<\/a> with an identical logo on the front label; however, the system's controller was conspicuously absent. The console's form factor and accompanying cartridges depicted in these early promotional images were essentially identical to the Nintendo 64's final design upon its retail launch in Japan two years later. Around the same time as the \"Ultra 64\" reveal, Nintendo also signed an agreement with <a href=\"\/midway-games\/3010-185\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-185\">Midway's<\/a> parent company Williams, allowing Midway to develop and market <a href=\"\/arcade\/3045-84\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade<\/a> games based on an arcade-specific variant of the Project Reality hardware. The result of this agreement was two arcade titles, <a href=\"\/killer-instinct\/3030-18484\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18484\">Killer Instinct<\/a> and <a href=\"\/cruisn-usa\/3030-9890\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9890\">Cruis'n USA<\/a>, both of which reference the \"Ultra 64\" during their <a href=\"\/attract-mode\/3015-1641\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1641\">attract modes<\/a>.<\/p><p>In November 1995, Nintendo unveiled the final version of their upcoming console which was re-branded simply as \"Nintendo 64,\" a new name proposed by <a href=\"\/shigesato-itoi\/3040-40611\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-40611\">Shigesato Itoi<\/a>. After pushing back the N64's initial \"late 1995\" launch date by several months to April 1996, the system's Japanese launch was again delayed until June of the same year, with Nintendo stating that the N64's <a href=\"\/launch-titles\/3015-238\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-238\">initial software lineup<\/a> needed more time to mature. However, a former SGI engineer named Adrian Sfarti claimed that hardware issues with the console itself were actually to blame for the delays. Nintendo's marketing team attempted to address the N64's repeated delays with pre-release advertisements featuring slogans such as \"Is it worth the wait? Only if you want the best\".<\/p><h3>Reception &amp; Legacy<\/h3><p>The Nintendo 64 was a commercial success but did not not gain popularity as widespread as the <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">Playstation<\/a> (especially in Japan) nor did it have a vast array of third-party titles. Although it didn't sell as well as Nintendo's earlier machines, it marked a history in video games as it was the console that showed gamers how 2D play styles could be adapted into a 3D world with the analog stick, rumble, and built-in 4 player support. Many of the games on the console (like <i>Super Mario 64<\/i>, <a href=\"\/goldeneye-007\/3030-3166\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3166\"><i>Golden Eye<\/i><\/a>, and <a href=\"\/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time\/3030-12572\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12572\"><i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time<\/i><\/a>) innovated their genre and brought it over to the 3D world.<\/p><p>Thanks to Super Mario 64's 3D gameplay, it started a new trend for free-roaming gameplay and has influenced many series to go in that direction ( <a href=\"\/grand-theft-auto\/3025-6\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-6\"><i>Grand Theft Auto<\/i><\/a>, for example). <i>Golden Eye<\/i> arguably presented the first compelling argument for <a href=\"\/games\/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=32\/\">First Person Shooters<\/a> on consoles, and was widely lauded for its multiplayer. <a href=\"\/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time\/3030-12572\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12572\"><i>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time<\/i><\/a> is considered by many as one of the best games of that generation (getting perfect 10 scores from many reviewers like IGN and Gamespot). Its 3D free-roaming gameplay revolutionized the adventure genre.<\/p><p>The system also introduced several new ideas to the gaming industry. The Nintendo 64 was the first console to introduce a rumble feature to their controller. The Rumble Pak was packaged with <i>Star Fox 64<\/i> in 1997. It was a huge leap into getting the player involved in the experience and the feature has been implemented in every controller since then (most notably the <a href=\"\/dualshock-controller\/3000-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3000-1\">DualShock<\/a> lineup for the <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">Playstation<\/a>).<\/p><p>It also helped a trend to transfer data from handhelds. Although the <a href=\"\/super-game-boy-enhancement\/3015-4804\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4804\">Super Game Boy<\/a> was the first accessory to play <a href=\"\/game-boy\/3045-3\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy<\/a> games on the TV, the Transfer Pak was the first to use data from the games and use them in games. Many games like <a href=\"\/pokemon-stadium\/3030-7270\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7270\">Pokemon Stadium<\/a> (in which the Transfer Pak was packaged in with) and <a href=\"\/pokemon-stadium-2\/3030-6132\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6132\">Pokemon Stadium 2<\/a> used the Pokemon games for the <a href=\"\/game-boy\/3045-3\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy<\/a> to transfer your Pokemon over from the game and use them to fight on their console counterparts (you were also able to play the Pokemon games on your TV). This idea was used for many other systems to come like the <a href=\"\/gamecube\/3045-23\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">Gamecube<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wii\/3045-36\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii<\/a>, <a href=\"\/playstation-2\/3045-19\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">Playstation 2<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/playstation-3\/3045-35\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">Playstation 3<\/a>.<\/p><p>The Nintendo 64 was succeeded by Nintendo's <a href=\"\/gamecube\/3045-23\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-23\">GameCube<\/a> in November 2001, but the N64 itself remained in production until its discontinuation in Japan on April 30, 2002, in Australia on May 11, 2003, in Europe on May 16, 2003, and in North America on November 30, 2003.<\/p><h2>Accessories<\/h2><h3>Controller<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/968375-n64_controller.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-968375\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.92533333333333\" data-width=\"375\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 375px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/968375-n64_controller.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-968375\"><img alt=\"The Nintendo 64 Controller\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/968375-n64_controller.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/968375-n64_controller.jpg 375w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7465\/968375-n64_controller.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>The Nintendo 64 Controller<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Nintendo 64 featured a unique controller that could be held multiple ways.

It allowed the reading of magnetic disks that were larger in capacity to cartridges and allowed for saving data in them.<\/p><p>It was heavily hyped before the system was released. Over time, however, hype for the add-on significantly tapered with consumers expressing concern over having to pay for the system just to play some highly anticipated games. Several games initially planned for the 64DD such as Mario RPG 2 (later renamed <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/paper-mario\/3030-19929\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19929\">Paper Mario<\/a>) and Zelda Gaiden (later renamed <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask\/3030-13594\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13594\">Majora's Mask<\/a>) were instead released on N64 cartridges as opposed to 64DD disks primarily due to the add on being significantly delay.<\/p><p>The 64DD was eventually released in Japan in December of 1999, with a North American release planned for 2000. However; the idea was ultimately canned. Even in Japan it was only sold through Nintendo's subscription based service <a href=\"\/randnet\/3015-7464\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7464\">RANDnet<\/a>, and not through ordinary stores.

            "description": "<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>In 1995 Shoshinkai game show (Space World today) in <a href=\"\/japan\/3035-37\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan<\/a>, <a href=\"\/nintendo\/3010-90\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo<\/a> first announced their plans to release the 64DD (Dynamic Drive) system. In 1997 <a href=\"\/shigeru-miyamoto\/3040-614\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-614\">Shigeru Miyamoto<\/a> gave more details about the systems abilities and forthcoming games, of which most were never released. The disc drive add-on connected to the <a href=\"\/nintendo-64\/3045-43\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64<\/a>\u2019s EXT port located underneath the console. It wasn\u2019t until 1999, towards the end of the N64\u2019s production life, that 64DD add-on became available to the public. The 64DD was never available outside of Japan.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, Nintendo created the system using a technology that was all but defunct by the time of its release. Offering an alternate format to the cartridge which utilized rewritable magnetic discs rather than the CD-ROM format of Nintendo\u2019s main rivals. While the technology may have seemed fanciful to audiences outside of Japan, Nintendo already had experience utilizing disk drives with their systems (i.e. the <a href=\"\/famicom-disk-system\/3045-91\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-91\">Famicom Disk System<\/a>). The format also shared with cartridges the benefit of difficulty in pirating while alleviating the space constraints of traditional cartridges and the loading times endemic to the CD-ROM based systems of the time. However, production costs for the magnetic discs used with the system remained higher than that of CD-ROM media. As a result, and 3rd party developer interest sank since the ubiquitous CD-ROM disk could be made for pennies and while a great deal more space than was available via the 64DD.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3104\/513949-64dd_box.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-513949\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.76142131979695\" data-width=\"197\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 197px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3104\/513949-64dd_box.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-513949\"><img alt=\"64DD Console Box.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3104\/513949-64dd_box.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3104\/513949-64dd_box.jpg 197w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px\" data-width=\"197\"><\/a><figcaption>64DD Console Box.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Nintendo offered the 64DD through a mail order subscription service in Japan that cost subscribers \u00a52,500 a month, for a 12-month contract. What they got for that price was the 64DD hardware unit, including a 4MB RAM expansion pack, a modem cartridge including the cables, software, and access to the RAND net online service. Further, games and additional software programs were to be shipped out to clients periodically<\/p><p>The magnetic disc had a storage capacity of 64MB and was a lot like Zip discs for PCs. The main advantage of using these discs is that they are encased in a tough shell, so they were a lot more durable than a CD and were a lot cheaper to manufacture than the N64 cartridge (still a lot more than the CD though), also load times were very quick, rarely exceeding five second loading times, with three or four seconds being the average speed for a game to load up. Along with the magnetic disc, the 64DD also had some interesting features that promised to revolutionize the gaming industry and Nintendo\u2018s N64 platform.<\/p><p>The system was obviously designed to play new and original 64DD game releases, and nine full 64DD games were actually released (four of which were different versions of Mario paint) for the system. But it wasn\u2019t the new game releases that got video games players interested and intrigued with 64DD platform. It was the concept of the expansion kit disc\u2019s, that provided further content for previously released Nintendo 64 games. The only expansion kit released that utilized the power of both systems was the F-Zero X Expansion Kit. With many others being proposed, but never released.<\/p><p>The 64DD\u2019s online feature was made possible by Nintendo creating the RAND network, which was a little bit like satellite view for the Super Nintendo. Everything you needed to get the 64DD online was included in the starter pack on its release in late 1999. Part of this package was the Nexus developed internet modem that plugged into the N64\u2019s cartridge slot. Once you were connected to the internet you could take advantage of number of options, which included a web browser, access to a member\u2019s only information page, an online message board for communicating with other 64DD users, the option of sending messages to the actual game programmers, beta testing, listening to music online (that was of a CD quality) and an online magazine that covered news, sports and weather. When it came to online gaming they had the choice, to either play against other people or simply observe others playing games or applications. The most popular feature on the RAND net, was its ability for users to share and swap what they had created using the Mario Artist creative programs with other 64DD subscribers.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3104\/513962-nintendo_64dd_disk.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-513962\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75853350189633\" data-width=\"791\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 791px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3104\/513962-nintendo_64dd_disk.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-513962\"><img alt=\"64DD Magnetic Disc.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3104\/513962-nintendo_64dd_disk.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3104\/513962-nintendo_64dd_disk.jpg 791w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3104\/513962-nintendo_64dd_disk.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/a><figcaption>64DD Magnetic Disc.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In February of 2001, the RAND net service was canceled. Even though it enjoyed moderate success, with a cult status in Japan, the somewhat limited user base just wasn\u2019t enough to justify its continued existence as a platform. The service was offered for free after the cancellation date was announced by Nintendo up until the plug was finally pulled. Once the RAND net service was disabled, Nintendo began buying back all the related software and hardware, which would be useless with out the service, but all other DD hardware and software could be kept.<\/p><p>The 64DD add-on only managed to sell 15,000 units in Japan and was classified as a commercial failure for Nintendo. Often being compared to all the add-ons Sega piled onto the Genesis\/Mega Drive (e.g. <a href=\"\/sega-32x\/3045-31\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-31\">Sega 32X<\/a>). Nintendo didn\u2019t completely walk away from this empty handed though, and if anything the 64DD was more of an experiment giving them a chance to trial new ideas (online games and internet access), some of which became standard features in Nintendo's future products and consoles.<\/p><p>The 4MB RAM cartridge took on a new life of its own, being released to the rest of the world as an expansion pack for the N64 console and was bundled in with selected titles to help enhance the graphical performance of the system. The 64DD was an interesting concept for its time, which had massive potential, and maybe things would have turned out a lot differently if the system wasn\u2019t delayed for such a long period of time and more support was given to the platform by 3rd party developers.<\/p><h2>Unreleased Titles<\/h2><p>Prior to its fate as a commercial failure, the 64DD had a variety of titles being worked on for it.

The games usually sell for around $80-$100 but can also go for over $200. The system itself is much harder to come by and usually sells for $1000+ if in good condition with all inserts.<\/p>",

The touch screen can register only one point of input at a time.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/813144-nintendo_wi_fi_connection_logo.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-813144\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 200px\" data-ratio=\"1.005\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/813144-nintendo_wi_fi_connection_logo.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-813144\"><img alt=\"Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection logo\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/813144-nintendo_wi_fi_connection_logo.gif\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7465\/813144-nintendo_wi_fi_connection_logo.gif 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"><\/a><figcaption>Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection logo<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Every version of the DS features a built-in microphone, and games may require players to yell, blow, or talk into the microphone as a type of input.

The DSi is 12% thinner than the DS Lite, due to the removal of the GBA slot at the bottom of the system. The screens on the system are slightly larger than those on previous versions at 3.25 inches. The DSi comes with an external 0.3 MP (megapixel) camera and a front-facing camera built into the hinge of the system. The DSi also comes with an SD and SDHC card slot on the side and has 256 MB flash memory built in.<\/p><p>Nintendo also launched the DSi Store, which carries <a href=\"\/dsiware\/3045-106\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-106\">DSiWare<\/a> games and software. The store uses the renamed Nintendo Points, 1000 of which came free with the DSi until March 2010, and content is priced at 0, 200, 500, or 800 points. Nintendo Points cards can only be used for one platform at a time, and Points from a single card cannot be shared between the two platforms.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7439\/719895-nintendo_points.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-719895\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 399px\" data-ratio=\"0.75187969924812\" data-width=\"399\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7439\/719895-nintendo_points.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-719895\"><img alt=\"Nintendo Points Card\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7439\/719895-nintendo_points.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7439\/719895-nintendo_points.jpeg 399w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7439\/719895-nintendo_points.jpeg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Nintendo Points Card\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7439\/719895-nintendo_points.jpeg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/7439\/719895-nintendo_points.jpeg 399w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/7439\/719895-nintendo_points.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Nintendo Points Card<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The DSi launched in Japan on November 1st, 2008 for \u00a518,900 ($178).

Users were Initially able to access the following programs from the main menu: DSi Camera, DSi Sound, DSi Shop, PictoChat, and download play, although this has been improved upon. The menu also includes icons for starting a game from a DS cartridge and accessing system settings.<\/p><p>The Nintendo DSi comes with a free <a href=\"\/nintendo-dsi-browser\/3030-24931\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24931\">Web Browser<\/a> made by Opera which uses built-in RAM, a more efficient alternative to the DS add-on web browser, which came with RAM that went into the GBA port.<\/p><p>The DSi's menu is based on the Wii Channel interface.

This strategy will allow developers to take advantage of DSi-specific features.

While most of the companies engineers continued to work on the <a href=\"\/game-watch\/3025-1183\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1183\">Game &amp; Watch<\/a> product line, Uemura set to work researching and designing what would later become the Nintendo Entertainment System. As more and more engineers began to transition over to help Uemura design the machine several key discussions arose to determine the internal workings of the machine.<\/p><h4>Selecting the CPU:<\/h4><p>The most significant decision made being the choice of CPU used in the console. Uemura wanted the CPU to be small enough to allow a sound chip to be integrated onto the board to reduce costs and due to Nintendo's relationship with chip manufacturer Ricoh whose 6502 processor met the requirements the initial reaction was to use the Ricoh 6502 processor. Within the company however several of the engineers disputed this choice in favour of the Z80 processor to allow the source code of the game Donkey Kong to be used. As the chief engineer though Uemura selected to use the Ricoh 6502 processor and so the company was forced to develop Donkey Kong from scratch. Another key decision would be the selection of the color palette of the console and so Uemura went to <a href=\"\/shigeru-miyamoto\/3040-614\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-614\">Shigeru Miyamoto<\/a> to assist with the color choice by asking him what and how many colors would be needed to recreate his games.<\/p><h4>The design of the controller:<\/h4><p>Another heated aspect of the design within the company was that of the controller. Having designed arcade games in the past, several of the engineers believed a joystick controller (similar to that of the <a href=\"\/atari-2600\/3045-40\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-40\">Atari 2600<\/a>) should be the included with the console. One engineer who worked on the project however having just assisted the Game &amp; Watch team with the creation of the Donkey Kong Game &amp; Watch took the control unit created for it, removed the screen and connected it to a Famicom system as a test. Realising that the Famicom controllers should utilise the revolutionary D-pad created for the Donkey Kong Game &amp; Watch and that the D-pad was intuitive enough to use that players could focus on the screen opposed to the controller so it was decided that the controller design should incorporate a D-pad over a joystick.<\/p><h4>The decision to use cartridges for games:<\/h4><p>The choice to use cartridges came from the decision that the sole purpose of the console would be to play video games meaning that the data on the cartridge wouldn't need to be altered after release. Thus the company decided to use ROM data and styled the Japanese cartridges after audio cassettes to allow Japanese consumers to use pre-existing household furniture and containers to store their game collection.<\/p><h4>The origins of Famicom red:<\/h4><p>The iconic Famicom red color choice came when the discussion of what color to make the console arose and due to Nintendo president <a href=\"\/hiroshi-yamauchi\/3040-615\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-615\">Hiroshi Yamauchi's <\/a>favourite color being red the decision was made to use the same shade of red as the president's scarf.<\/p><h4>The origins of the name Famicom:<\/h4><p>The Japanese name of 'Family Computer' (later Famicom) was not given to the console until shortly before its release and came from a conversation between Uemura and his wife. Uemura, who often discussed his work with his wife, explained one evening that the console was still without a name and despite personal computers already existing in Japan that the console shouldn't be seen as a \"personal\" device and instead one for the entire family. Thus Uemura explained it should be called the \"Family Computer\" to which his wife responded \"Okay but it has to be Famicom. You have to make it shorter.\". Liking the name \"Famicom\" Uemura took the idea straight to company president Yaumauchi the next day and explained the reasoning behind the name but Yaumauchi was not in favour of the name claiming \"No, it's not a good idea to shorten the words at the beginning. If people want to start calling it that later, that's okay, but at the start we need to call it 'Family Computer'.\".<\/p><h4>The initial Japanese release:<\/h4><p>The console was first released in Japan on July 15, 1983 with the three launch titles of <a href=\"\/donkey-kong\/3030-311\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-311\">Donkey Kong<\/a>, <a href=\"\/donkey-kong-jr\/3030-19416\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19416\">Donkey Kong Jr.<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/popeye\/3030-14419\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14419\">Popeye<\/a> available. The console sold around 400,000 units in its first year though approximately 100,000 units were returned as faulty due to the initial wave of consoles being prone to crashes due to defects in some of the graphics chips created by Ricoh as well as the issue of owners damaging the controllers of the console which were hard-wired into the console to save on costs over implementing a joypad connector to the console. This decision was later reverted to allow for damaged controllers to be easily replaced via simply buying and plugging in a replacement controller.<\/p><p>By the end of 1983 the initial wave of the Famicom stock had sold out but when retailers in February of the following year kept on requesting additional stock the console was resupplied complete with a new motherboard to fix the issue with the graphics chips and the Famicom swiftly became incredibly popular.<\/p><h4>Entering the American market:<\/h4><p>In an effort to enter the North American market, Nintendo negotiated with Atari to release the Famicom as the Nintendo Advanced Video Gaming System but the deal would fail to materialise. In June of 1985, Nintendo unveiled the North American version of the Famicom (the Nintendo Entertainment System) which had undergone several cosmetic changes from the original Famicom system. For instance, the console was stylised to make it look more like a VCR and was colored with shades of grey to make it blend in better with the traditional television setup. Its controllers were also redesigned to accommodate for the larger hands of American children, the controllers were made detachable from the console based off the past experience with the non-detachable controllers of the Famicom and the problems which arose due to this design aspect. The built-in microphone of the controller was removed to save costs and because of the belief that the intent to use the microphone for karaoke would not be as appealing as it was in Japan.<\/p><p>On October 18, 1985, the NES was released, along with eighteen launch titles. Two boxed sets were released, the Deluxe Set (console, <a href=\"\/rob\/3005-1707\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1707\">R.O.B<\/a>., <a href=\"\/light-gun\/3015-2354\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2354\">Zapper<\/a>, two controllers, <a href=\"\/duck-hunt\/3030-2758\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2758\">Duck Hunt<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/gyromite\/3030-20055\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20055\">Gyromite<\/a>) and the Control Deck (console, two controllers and <a href=\"\/super-mario-bros\/3030-15544\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\">Super Mario Bros.<\/a>).<\/p><p>Nintendo initially had a hard time selling the NES to retailers due to most believing the video game home console market to have died with the crash of 1983. Realising this Nintendo marketed the NES as a toy opposed to a video game system. They packed in a light gun and a robot with the console and people started to pay attention. In December of 1985 Nintendo went to toy stores around New York City to try and sell the NES negotiating that if the consoles don't sell they will buy them back. This gave Nintendo a foothold but they still required getting the NES into the hands of more people if the product was to be a success.<\/p><p>The company then contacted Worlds of Wonder, a toy company who made two of the most popular toys of 1985, Lazer Tag and Teddy Ruxpin, claiming if they could get Nintendo into the same big department stores as their toys were in that they could have a percentage of Nintendo's sales. Worlds of Wonder agreed to this deal, so whenever a store called and wanted to order a toy, they would require that store to order 500 NES consoles. With this deal in place Nintendo had now made their first steps into the American market.<\/p><p>The NES was an enormous success in Japan and North America, dominating the competition in both regions. In comparison to its considerable success in Japan and North America, however, the NES had much less success in Europe and <a href=\"\/south-america\/3035-2906\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2906\">South America<\/a>, with <a title=\"Sega\" href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega<\/a>'s <a title=\"Sega Master System\" href=\"\/sega-master-system\/3045-8\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-8\">Master System<\/a> being significantly more successful than the NES in these regions.

Nintendo had a veritable monopoly on the market at the time, so they encouraged developers to make games for their console. But, developers had to sign a contract stating they would only develop games for the NES. Also, a chip was instituted into the NES called the 10NES. If this same chip was not found in the cartridge, the game wouldn't load. Eventually, however, these business practices were ultimately outlawed.<\/p><p>Despite Nintendo's efforts, unlicensed games were still created for the system. Designers found ways to bypass the 10NES chip. One such way was to short circuit the chip, temporarily ceasing its function. However, <a href=\"\/atari-games-corporation\/3010-794\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-794\">Atari Games<\/a> created unlicensed software for the NES under the name <a href=\"\/tengen\/3010-752\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-752\">Tengen<\/a>. Tengen didn't want to be held liable for short-circuiting and possibly damaging the NES, so they devised a chip (nicknamed Rabbit) that disabled the 10NES chip.

Known as the top-loader, this version is nearly identical to the original model, but it has several key differences. The main difference, and the reason for its nickname, is the fact that cartridges are loaded into a slot on the top of the console, rather than through a tray at the front. It also sported a different color scheme and more round edged controllers similar in design to those of the <a href=\"\/super-nintendo-entertainment-system\/3045-9\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System<\/a>. It also featured a redesigned logo and modified circuit boards to improve the video output.NES-101 was known as HVC-101 in Japan, and was released on December 1, 1993.<\/p><h2>Accessories<\/h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Nintendo Zapper<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>The Zapper was a light gun that came bundled with the NES later on in its life span.

Although the models look totally different the cartridges fit perfectly and run perfectly. The Famulator was priced 2,980 Japanese Yen, which adds up to roughly 30 American Dollars, creating a cheap and small NES for retro gamers. The Famulator comes with two controllers with the typical A &amp; B buttons but an add on with AA &amp; BB which are just double the speed of the regular A &amp; B buttons.

The Dendy differs slightly from the NES in terms of hardware, containing a slightly different chipset. There were several variations of the Dendy, such as Dendy Classic and Dendy Junior. Cartridges were typically bootleg versions of official games, or even compilations, and were similar in appearance to the Famicom cartridges.<\/p>",

            "description": "<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>NUON was a failed attempt by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2638\" href=\"\/toshiba-corporation\/3010-2638\/\" slug=\"toshiba-corporation\">Toshiba<\/a>, Motorola, Samsung, and Raite Optoelectronics to add gaming, internet, and enhanced navigation to certain DVD players. NUON technology was developed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-4939\" href=\"\/vmi\/3010-4939\/\" slug=\"vmi\">VM Labs Inc<\/a>. as an attempt to turn passive digital video into an interactive experience. NUON DVD players were supposed to be the \"all-in-one\" digital media experience. Richard Miller, using experience gained developing <a data-ref-id=\"3010-182\" href=\"\/atari-inc\/3010-182\/\" slug=\"atari-inc\">Atari<\/a> <a data-ref-id=\"3045-28\" href=\"\/jaguar\/3045-28\/\" slug=\"jaguar\">Jaguar<\/a> hardware, created a powerful 128-bit processor to embed in DVD players. The NUON had the power to decode audio and video while providing and enhanced UI and trick-play modes. More importantly, it provided a platform for 3D digital interactive content straight from a DVD player. NUON technology was only added to a handful of DVD players and support for the platform was abysmal. VM Labs filed for bankruptcy in 2001, just one year after the release of the NUON. VM Labs sold the NUON technology to Genesis Microchip, where development ceased after July 2002.<\/p><h2>Hardware<\/h2><p>At the core of the NUON is the Aries 3 chip, which was based on a 128-bit, 4 way parallel VLIW processor architecture. It manages the CPU, decodes audio and video, and preforms all system management. A hardware block on the chip assisted with MPEG video decoding so the Aries 3 was free to process other instructions. The chip was very powerful for it's time.<\/p><p>Features of the Aries 3:<\/p><ul><li>MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 audio\/video decoding<\/li><li>5.1 channel Dolby Digital audio decoding<\/li><li>Extended DVD trick modes<\/li><li>32-voice wave table synthesizer<\/li><li>MP3 audio decoding<\/li><li>Content Scrambling System descrambling module<\/li><li>Video Scaling<\/li><li>3D video gaming<\/li><\/ul><p>The first DVD player to use NUON technology was the Toshiba SD-2300. The technology in the few available NUON DVD players raised the price around $100 over comparable players. The choice to market games to the movie audience ultimately ended up being a mistake. Sales were very poor, and support was absolutely terrible. The first NUON enhanced DVD was the software\/movie Bedazzled by Fox Home Video. Just about every other publisher waited on the technology and support never truly came to the device. With the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-19\" href=\"\/playstation-2\/3045-19\/\" slug=\"playstation-2\">PlayStation 2<\/a>'s release imminent as a game console that plays DVDs rather than a DVD player that plays games, the chances of success for the NUON had gone. The public opted for the game console that was cheaper and had much better support for games.<\/p><p>The NUON had a variety of controllers, one popular standard one being white in color with a D-pad with 4 buttons. The stealth gamepad is 3-pronged controller with a mini analog stick, a D-pad, and a trigger button. It is designed very similarly to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-43\" href=\"\/nintendo-64\/3045-43\/\" slug=\"nintendo-64\">Nintendo 64<\/a>'s controller. A memory unit was planned for Q1 2002 release for the NUON in sizes ranging from 2MB to 4MB, but was canceled. Many games used passwords to make up for the lack of a released memory card.<\/p><h2>Software<\/h2><p>Only eight games were ever released for NUON. The graphics are comparable to early <a data-ref-id=\"3045-19\" href=\"\/playstation-2\/3045-19\/\" slug=\"playstation-2\">PlayStation 2<\/a> games, and are most notable in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20761\" href=\"\/iron-soldier-3\/3030-20761\/\" slug=\"iron-soldier-3\">Iron Soldier 3<\/a>, a mech combat game. The best game is generally regarded to be <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25964\" href=\"\/tempest-3000\/3030-25964\/\" slug=\"tempest-3000\">Tempest 3000<\/a> (many sources consider it the only truly playable game) and it's valued at much more than the other NUON games. Games were controlled via a proprietary controller. Depending on the model, there could be one or two controller ports.<\/p><h2>Homebrew<\/h2><p>The NUON homebrew community was more active than the commercial community. In late 2001, VM Labs released a homebrew SDK so developers could put out their own homebrew NUON software, even as the platform died and faded into obscurity.

            "description": "<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>The <a href=\"\/magnavox\/3010-1164\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1164\">Magnavox<\/a> Odyssey is the very first video game system. It was released in Fall of 1972 and was designed by <a href=\"\/ralph-baer\/3040-89698\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89698\">Ralph Baer<\/a> in 1968. The prototype Odyssey (referred to as the \"Brown Box\") that Baer got to work in 1968 is now in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C.<\/p><p>The Odyssey's sales were poor due to bad marketing by Magnavox retail stores and the consumer misconception that the Odyssey only worked on Magnavox televisions.<\/p><p>Magnavox settled or won many court cases against various companies including <a href=\"\/nolan-bushnell\/3040-89534\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89534\">Nolan Bushnell<\/a> for eerie resemblance between Bushnell's Pong and Tennis for the Odyssey.<\/p><p>The Odyssey also had the first optical video game <a href=\"\/light-gun\/3015-2354\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2354\">light gun<\/a>, which was made for the Odyssey game <a href=\"\/shooting-gallery\/3030-9438\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9438\">Shooting Gallery<\/a>. However, you would not need to point the light gun at the screen to be successful. It would recognize any light source as the screen. This made it so pointing the gun at any light source would count as a hit.<\/p><p>In total the Odyssey had about 30 games. Most (if not all) of the games were built into the system itself. The system however used cartridges to tell the system which game (or series of games) to play.<\/p><p>Most of the games on the Magnavox bear little resemblance to the games of today. Most of the games were two player only, and consisted almost exclusively of two white blocks on the screen which the players could move via dial controllers. To get around the graphical limitations Magnavox included various <a href=\"\/screen-overlay\/3015-7386\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7386\">overlays<\/a> with the various carts.<\/p><h2>Games<\/h2><p>A Simon-says type variant where one moves the white block to a part of a body on an overlay of a boy and a girl.<\/p><p>A roulette game where players placed a poker chip on a (physical) numbered sheet, and hope that the white block goes into their desired number on the overlay.<\/p><p>A 50 state educational game where one player would name a state and the other would have to place the white block so it would appear in the state on the overlay<\/p><p>Various shooting games where the white block would appear behind an overlay lighting up various targets.<\/p><p>And many more of that ilk. In fact other than a basic table tennis game (which would later be copied by Atari as \"Pong\") a majority of the games relied almost as much on the overlay and an imagination as it did on the image appearing on the television.<\/p><h2>Technical specifications<\/h2><h3>CPU<\/h3><ul><li>No actual CPU, just very simple logic circuitry.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Memory<\/h3><ul><li>Internal RAM: 64 bytes<\/li><li>Audio\/video RAM: 128 bytes<\/li><li>BIOS ROM: 1024 bytes<\/li><\/ul><h3>Video<\/h3><ul><li>160\u00d7200 resolution (NTSC)<\/li><li>Simplistic Analog Video System<\/li><\/ul><h3>Audio<\/h3><ul><li>No Audio<\/li><\/ul><h3>Input<\/h3><ul><li>Two 8-way, one-button, digital joysticks.

The technological innovation lead to an increase amount of diversity in the video game industry in the form of videos games and the consoles that played them. However with innovation came adoption and after the release of the Channel F Atari came up with the Atari VCS (later renamed the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-40\" href=\"\/atari-2600\/3045-40\/\" slug=\"atari-2600\">     Atari 2600<\/a>). \u00a0 <br\/>\u00a0<br\/>However caught in the middle of all of this was the Magnavox reeling from the success of their non-programmable console the Odyssey. However by the time the Channel F and Atari 2600 had been released Magnaovx had already begun designing a new non-programmable console that would succeed the Odyssey. Forced to make an important decision Magnavox scrapped the design in favor of a cartride capable console in a darring attempt to break out of the over saturated dedicated console market. With expectations that technology would lead the console to sucess Magnavox released the Odyssey 2 with high expectations in 1978<br\/><br\/><h2>Technical Design<\/h2>The console that was released in 1978 differed greatly from the console Magnavox originally had invisioned. Firstly it was a programable console capable of utilizing ROm cartridges. Also the Odyssey 2's CPU could utilize background music scoring, better graphics, as well as better gameplay when compared to its predecessor. <br\/><br\/>The Magnavox designers also want to differentiate their from their competition in the form of how players actually palyed their game. Firstly unlike any other system at that time, the Odyssey 2 also included a full alpha-numeric touch pad keyboard. This lead to a small active group of developers for the console to design educational games for the console which would go onto to be a marketed selling point for the console.<br\/><br\/>For hand held controllers, the Odyssey 2 utilized the classic joystick design of the 1970s and 80s:\u00a0 A moderately sized, self centering eight way joystick.\u00a0 It was held in the left hand, and manipulated with the right hand.\u00a0 In the upper corner of the joystick was a single 'Action' button.\u00a0 A credit to the designers at Magnavox, three or four years later, with Atari, <a data-ref-id=\"3045-51\" href=\"\/intellivision\/3045-51\/\" slug=\"intellivision\">        Intellivision<\/a>, and a number of third party companies producing hardware, many people still felt that the Odyssey 2 joystick was one of the best designed.<br\/><br\/><h2>Sales<\/h2>While by no means a failure the Odyssey 2 had failed to really catch on the way other consoles had at the time. By the early 80's The landscape for video game consoles had greatly changed. Atari had gain a significant foothold on the market. Fairchild had left only to be replaced by Intellivision and (latter) <a data-ref-id=\"3045-47\" href=\"\/colecovision\/3045-47\/\" slug=\"colecovision\">    Colecovision<\/a>. While the sales of these consoles grew greatly as months and years passed by usership of the Odyssey 2 had remained stagnant. Nevertheless various developers refused to drop support for the console. Developers such as<a data-ref-id=\"3010-48\" href=\"\/philips-interactive-media-inc\/3010-48\/\" slug=\"philips-interactive-media-inc\">        Philips<\/a> kept on supporting the Odyssey 2 well until the death of the console.\u00a0 With a slow but steady stream of of games being released for the console as well as a child and educational friendly image the console sold around one million units in the United States.<br\/>\u00a0<br\/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14011\/1361216-videopac_poster.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1361216\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4925373134328\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14011\/1361216-videopac_poster.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1361216\"><img alt=\"Video Pac Game Leaflet\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/14011\/1361216-videopac_poster.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/14011\/1361216-videopac_poster.jpg 938w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/14011\/1361216-videopac_poster.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/a><figcaption>Video Pac Game Leaflet<\/figcaption><\/figure>     As for overseas sales the Odyssey 2\u00a0 started the unusual trend (i.e.<a data-ref-id=\"3045-8\" href=\"\/sega-master-system\/3045-8\/\" slug=\"sega-master-system\">    Sega Master System<\/a>)\u00a0 of consoles that did poorly in the States that going onto be suprise successes in other overseas markets.Part of the reason for this was that the European release for the console was marketed and planned out by Magnavox's parent company and electronics giant Philips Electronics.\u00a0 In Europe (and in other parts of the world as well) the Odyssey 2 was sold as the Philips G7000 Videopac console.

            "description": "<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>The Ouya (pronounced \"ooh ya\") is an android based video game console released in 2013. The idea of the console is that every console can essentially be used as a \"development console\" and thus developers have a much lower barrier to entry than on competing consoles.<\/p><p>The Ouya, likely best-known for its meteoric rise in the <a href=\"\/kickstarter-funded\/3015-7378\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7378\">Kickstarter<\/a> space, initially shipped with <a href=\"\/android\/3045-123\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-123\">Android<\/a> 4.1 (Jelly Bean) as its base operating system. Developer consoles shipped in late 2012, and initial retail units began shipping to Kickstarter backers on March 28th, 2013.<\/p><p>In early 2013, Ouya received backing from sellers such as Gamestop and Amazon.<\/p><p>In January 2014, the Ouya team released a new version of the console with minor modifications to the original. For example, the internal storage is now increased to 16GB.<\/p><h2>Software<\/h2><p>Ouya distributes games through its own Ouya store. Though an Android device, it is not considered compatible with Google's Android ecosystem and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ouya.tv\/faq\/#12\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">owners will not be able to officially play games they've already downloaded from Android's Google Play app store<\/a>. However, a recipient of one of the early consoles hinted that an Ouya owner could sideload app APK files onto the Ouya storage via USB connection to a PC, and then run those applications from a Settings &amp; Management menu on the Ouya UI. (This activity was not actually shown in the user's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C2KZcc-XzWc\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">YouTube video<\/a>.)<\/p><p>As of the initial shipping to backers, the lineup of upcoming software included <a href=\"\/fez\/3030-24768\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24768\">Fez<\/a>, <a href=\"\/wizorb\/3030-35666\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35666\">Wizorb<\/a> (which is currently available), <a href=\"\/broken-age\/3030-37448\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37448\">Broken Age<\/a>, and some other high-profile titles. (Much of what is available at the outset boasts titles from smaller developers including ports of existing mobile games such as <a href=\"\/canabalt\/3030-28976\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28976\">Canabalt HD<\/a>.) It was also reported that Ouya will support XBMC for streaming media.<\/p><p>There are conflicting messages about the viability of rooting the Ouya. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Android_rooting\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Rooting<\/a>, similar to jailbreaking <a href=\"\/iphone\/3045-96\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iOS<\/a> devices, is a common practice among advanced owners of Android devices, and Ouya founder <a href=\"\/julie-uhrman\/3040-69915\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-69915\">Julie Uhrman<\/a> mentioned that the process would be simple in the effort to make Ouya as open as possible. However, some XDA community members have pointed to a July 2012 radio interview with Uhrman where she mentioned that rooted Ouyas would not be able to access the Ouya Store, making it difficult for players who both want to purchase Ouya games and have the benefit of a rooted system. There seems to be no up-to-date, definitive answer on how the retail unit responds to or supports rooting.<\/p><p>The Ouya UI includes a \"Sandbox\" category, which is where games that aren't featured in the top tier of games (the \"Featured\", \"Genre\" and other categories on the UI's main screen) go. If you like a game in the sandbox, you can give it a \"Thumbs Up\", and if the title receives enough of these kudos, it may end up in the top tier for a wider audience to see.<\/p><p>One of the more controversial decisions of the software distribution method was that all games were initially required to have a free component. This requirement was only vaguely defined by Ouya themselves and thus they're are several free to play games as well as games that offer a free demo before requiring players to purchase the rest. Some consumers complained that this made it hard to determine which games were which as upon release Ouya's main storefront did not list any price for any games with many gamers finding out that a title was only a demo after they started playing the game. From a developer standpoint, many noted that the lack of actual sales on the marketplace were relatively low when compared with platform's userbase.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Controller<\/h2><p>Ouya's controller mimics today's standard inputs, with two analog sticks, four face buttons, a d-pad, a Home button, twin shoulder buttons and twin triggers. It also includes a central touch panel, similar to what Sony later announced for the <a href=\"\/playstation-4\/3045-146\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4<\/a> controller during its unveiling. It does not include a back button.<\/p><h2>Release<\/h2><p>The release of the console was somewhat controversial. The system began shipping to developers in late 2012. Because of the design of the console dictated that every console was a development console many press outlets began reviewing the console giving it unfavorable reviews, eventually Julie Uhrman stated that she though the reviews were unfair due to the differences from the eventual consumer model which led to questions as to why seemingly two tiers of the consoles were being release. Units for Kickstarter backers started shipping in the spring of 2013 with the console going on sale to the general public in early summer. However there were problems with some of the backer units particularly the controllers, furthermore many units did not reach backers in a timely manner with a few not reaching backers until after the retail release.<\/p><h2>Acquisition<\/h2><p>In June 2015, it was leaked on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mesaglobal.com\/all-transactions\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MESA Global's website<\/a> that they acted as exclusive financial advisor to OUYA in its sale to <a href=\"\/razer\/3010-6424\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6424\">Razer, Inc<\/a>. On July 27 of the same year, Razer officially announced the acquisition. Hardware assets were not a part of this purchase, and only personnel and software were acquired. Both assets were then focused on a storefront platform for Razer's own Forge TV console, dubbed \"Cortex\". In a <a href=\"https:\/\/insider.razerzone.com\/index.php?threads\/razer-ceo-ama-july-30-8pm-pdt.7734\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" topic<\/a>, Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan stated that they would be \"keeping the lights on for the next 12 months or so for the software services\" for the OUYA out of goodwill towards its install base, and their director of sales stated that \"[they're] looking at a variety of options to ensure that your OUYA doesn't become a high-tech paperweight.\"<\/p><p>Some developers continued to produce games and content for the OUYA following the shutdown of its submission service by way of offering their product on other sites and encouraging \"<a href=\"\/homebrew\/3015-4363\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4363\">side loading<\/a>\" of the games.<\/p>",

The first binary computer was the Z1 Computer, created by the German inventor Konrad Zuse. Other electronic computers would be created throughout the time period, including the ENIAC and the Harvard Mark I. Many of the first computers were used during <a href=\"\/world-war-ii\/3015-471\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-471\">World War II<\/a> by both factions and would be later used for scientific research. Early computers were large enough to fill a room, making them unusable for practical, personal use. Later it would be used by banks and large businesses for economic calculations. Companies like <a href=\"\/ibm\/3010-190\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-190\">IBM<\/a> have supplied many businesses with computers years before the personal computer.<\/p><h3>1970s<\/h3><p>It wasn't until the 1970s where computers usable for the average person were being made. Several revolutionary inventions paved the way to the modern personal computer, most importantly the microprocessor, a single-chip CPU. The concept originated from <a href=\"\/sharp-corporation\/3010-6509\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6509\">Sharp<\/a> engineer <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tadashi_Sasaki_(engineer)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tadashi Sasaki<\/a>, who in 1968 proposed the idea to <a href=\"\/japan\/3035-37\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japanese<\/a> <a href=\"\/calculator\/3055-2985\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2985\">calculator<\/a> manufacturer <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Busicom\" rel=\"nofollow\">Busicom<\/a> and <a href=\"\/the-united-states-of-america\/3035-396\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">American<\/a> manufacturer Intel, which both soon collaborated to produce the first microprocessor. By 1970, Intel engineer Federico Faggin and Busicom engineer <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Masatoshi_Shima\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masatoshi Shima<\/a> had completed their design of the world's first microprocessor, the 4-bit Intel 4004. The microprocessor helped in creating a more powerful central processing unit than the ones used in computers at the time and shrunk it so computers could be smaller. The microprocessor was the major invention that gave birth to the microcomputer, or the personal computer as it is known today.<\/p><p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.computerhistory.org\/timeline\/?year=1971\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kenbak-1<\/a>, created in 1970 by John V. Blakenbaker of the Kenbak Corporation, was an early attempt at a personal computer, despite the lack of a microprocessor. Starting in 1971, it was sold for $750 and only 40 machines were ever built and sold. In 1973, Kenbak folded and stopped production. It was based on TTL (transistor-transistor-logic) discrete circuitry (much like the <a href=\"\/odyssey\/3045-74\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-74\">Magnavox Odyssey<\/a> and <a href=\"\/pong\/3030-22195\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22195\">Pong<\/a>) rather than microprocessor technology (which has been used in nearly all video games since <a href=\"\/gun-fight\/3025-2838\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2838\">Gun Fight<\/a>). As such, it wasn't until later that the first \"true\" personal computers began appearing.<\/p><p>The first microprocessor-based personal computer, or microcomputer, was the <a href=\"http:\/\/museum.ipsj.or.jp\/en\/computer\/personal\/0086.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">SMP80\/08<\/a>, developed by Sord (now <a href=\"\/toshiba-corporation\/3010-2638\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2638\">Toshiba Personal Computer System Corporation<\/a>) in 1972, utilizing the 8-bit Intel 8008, which was followed in 1974 by the Sord SMP80\/x series, utilizing the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Intel_8080\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intel 8080<\/a>, an 8-bit microprocessor designed by Federico Faggin and Masatoshi Shima. It was then followed in 1975 by the Altair 8800, which also used the Intel 8080 as its CPU. Since the computer's main language was binary code and only had an output of flashing lights, the computer was unusable by the common person. A similar microcomputer was released by <a href=\"\/nec-home-electronics-ltd\/3010-2708\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2708\">NEC <\/a>in 1976, the TK-80, which used the Intel 8080A.<\/p><p>It wasn't until 1977 when two <a href=\"\/california\/3035-1719\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1719\">California <\/a>college students, <a href=\"\/steve-jobs\/3040-9951\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-9951\">Steve Jobs<\/a> and <a href=\"\/steve-wozniak\/3040-93519\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93519\">Steve Wozniak<\/a>, created the first personal computers with a monitor, the <a href=\"\/apple-ii\/3045-12\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-12\">Apple II<\/a>.

Visual interfaces that were controlled using a mouse allowed the common person who were not accustomed to using a terminal to navigate and use various visual applications on a computer. The GUI was first created by Xerox in the 1960s, but the company was not interested in entering the computer market. Apple was given the rights to use GUI for the <a href=\"\/mac\/3045-17\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Macintosh<\/a>, however, Microsoft was able to trick Apple into lending them prototype Macintosh computers to create programs for the new machines. They used the coding of the operating system to create Windows, an extension to DOS. Thanks to the cheap $100 price point and its compatibility with all DOS computers, Windows became a success, becoming the new standard of computers by the mid-1990s.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650295-alienware_malx_back.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1650295\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0761904761905\" data-width=\"420\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 420px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650295-alienware_malx_back.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1650295\"><img alt=\"Powerful laptops have made PC gaming mobile.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650295-alienware_malx_back.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650295-alienware_malx_back.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px\" data-width=\"594\"><\/a><figcaption>Powerful laptops have made PC gaming mobile.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The 1980s also saw the emergence of portable <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Laptop\" rel=\"nofollow\">laptop<\/a> computers.

It was followed by <a href=\"\/commodore\/3010-2000\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2000\">Commodore<\/a>'s SX 64 in 1984. The first mass-market laptop was <a href=\"\/toshiba-corporation\/3010-2638\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2638\">Toshiba<\/a>'s 16-bit T-1100 in 1985, which they followed with the T-3100 (the first with a built-in hard drive) in 1986.

Internet service providers such as America Online and Prodigy gave PC users cheap and easy access to the newly-formed network. Web browsers such as Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator allowed users to access various websites for nearly every task and interest, such as business, research, and general shopping. Search engines such as Yahoo and Google allowed users to navigate the internet with ease using only a few keywords instead of searching through \"sitebooks\" for a particular site. Although online games have existed since the 1970s, they've gained in popularity by the mid 90's as more and more people gained access to the internet.<\/p><p>Another important revolution for PC gaming was the introduction of <a href=\"\/polygonal-3d\/3015-1430\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">3D graphics<\/a> accelerator cards in the late 1990s, which allowed the PC to take the lead in cutting-edge 3D graphics technology by the 21st century. The first 3D graphics card for a home computer was <a href=\"\/nec-home-electronics-ltd\/3010-2708\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2708\">NEC<\/a>'s PC-FXGA, released for their <a href=\"\/nec-pc-9801\/3045-112\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-112\">PC-98<\/a> platform in 1995, which could produce 3D graphics surpassing the <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation <\/a>console and rivaling the <a href=\"\/nintendo-64\/3045-43\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-43\">Nintendo 64<\/a> in terms of polygon rendering performance. The first 3D graphics cards for IBM-compatible PC's soon followed in early 1996: Creative Labs' 3D Blaster, <a href=\"\/nvidia-corporation\/3010-6345\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6345\">NVIDIA<\/a>'s NV1, and particularly <a href=\"\/nec-home-electronics-ltd\/3010-2708\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2708\">NEC<\/a>'s PowerVR.

With Windows, people could easily browse through their files and do other simple functions much more quickly. Windows has grown in popularity and became the most popular OS in the world, having the support of PC makers like <a href=\"\/dell-inc\/3010-4850\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-4850\">Dell<\/a>, Gateway, and HP. Windows has gone through many iterations, starting with the MS-DOS days having Windows versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.11. Then came Windows NT 3.0-4.0 and Windows 2000 (oriented toward business) and the Windows 9x operating systems including Windows 95, 98, and ME (oriented toward home users). By the 2000's, Microsoft stopped building Windows versions based on DOS in favor of NET, starting with Windows XP.<\/p><p>The preferred platform for modern PC games (as of 2016) is a Windows PC running either Windows 7, 8(.1), or 10. As of 2014, Microsoft has ceased supporting Windows XP, however, various games and applications will still run on the OS using DirectX 9 or lower. Windows Vista and Windows 7 will allow users to run games that use DirectX 10 and 11, such as <a href=\"\/crysis\/3030-11757\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11757\">Crysis<\/a>, <a href=\"\/halo-2\/3030-7110\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7110\">Halo 2<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/battlefield-3\/3030-27006\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27006\">Battlefield 3<\/a>. DirectX 11.2 is exclusive to Windows 8, but not many games use this version. Windows 10 introduces DirectX 12, which is currently used in games like <a href=\"\/rise-of-the-tomb-raider\/3030-46549\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46549\">Rise of the Tomb Raider<\/a>, <a href=\"\/quantum-break\/3030-42696\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42696\">Quantum Break<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/ashes-of-the-singularity\/3030-49088\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-49088\">Ashes of the Singularity<\/a>.<\/p><p>Windows 7 provides gamers with a games browser that notifies the user of patches and updates for some games as they become available. Windows 7 is generally faster than Vista and fixes many of the issues people had with that OS such as intrusive Security settings and sluggish performance, Windows 7 also comes with DirectX 11. <a href=\"\/dirt-2\/3030-24513\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24513\">Dirt2<\/a> was among the first games to support this.<\/p><p>On October 25, 2012, Microsoft released Windows 8 to the public. This new operating system introduces the \"Metro\" interface, which makes menus more easily accessible to people who are using tablets and touch controls. Windows 8 also introduces its own app store which will allow developers to publish and distribute their Metro applications and games. <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/xbox-live\/3015-1404\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1404\">Xbox Live<\/a> is integrated with the OS which can be used as a user account for the computer and can earn <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/achievements\/3015-29\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-29\">achievement points<\/a> on games downloaded from the app store. There have been complaints about the new OS because of its lackluster desktop interface and the removal of the standard Start menu in favor of the Metro interface, but Windows 8.1 addressed some of these issues with the return of the Start menu and the ability to use windowed Metro apps.<\/p><p>On July 29, 2015, Microsoft released Windows 10 to the public. It's a free update for all Windows 7 and 8 users for the first year of release, making it the first Windows OS that is available for free. One of the major features of Windows 10 is it's cross compatibility with tablets and smartphones as well as desktop and laptop PCs, as well as being implemented for <a href=\"\/xbox-one\/3045-145\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One<\/a> consoles in the future. It also features a new voice companion called <a href=\"\/cortana\/3005-315\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-315\">Cortana<\/a>, which is meant to compete with Apple's Siri. For gaming, Windows 10 introduces DirectX 12, which allows programmers to get better performance out of older graphics hardware with less oversight. Although current graphics cards can support some of the features of DirectX 12, fully-featured DX12 cards are not expected to release until 2016. The first game to support DX12 will be Fable Legends, which is releasing as a free-to-play title by the end of 2015. It also introduces further connections with the Xbox brand, where Microsoft will be selling games with the Xbox brand on the App Store as well as allow you to stream games from the Xbox One on all Windows 10 devices.<\/p><h3>Mac OS<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650297-macosx102.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1650297\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650297-macosx102.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1650297\"><img alt=\"Apple's Mac OS has a limited but growing game library.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1650297-macosx102.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650297-macosx102.png 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/3661\/1650297-macosx102.png 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1650297-macosx102.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Apple's Mac OS has a limited but growing game library.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1650297-macosx102.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650297-macosx102.png 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/3661\/1650297-macosx102.png 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1650297-macosx102.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Apple's Mac OS has a limited but growing game library.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In 1976, <a href=\"\/steve-wozniak\/3040-93519\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93519\">Steve Wozniak<\/a> and <a href=\"\/steve-jobs\/3040-9951\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-9951\">Steve Jobs<\/a> made the Apple 1, Apple's first computer. They later gained popularity with the <a href=\"\/apple-ii\/3045-12\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-12\">Apple II<\/a>. In 1984, Apple released the <a href=\"\/mac\/3045-17\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Macintosh<\/a>, which was the first Apple computer to have an operating system. The Mac OS lineup was born. Later, Apple switched to Unix-like coding, creating the Mac OS X lineup, which is still used in the new Apple computer lineup today.<\/p><p>The main issue with gaming on a Mac OS is that almost all earlier Mac PCs were not compatible with Windows based video games. More recently however with the creation of applications such as Boot Camp and Parallels more games are able to be run. The development of Intel x86-based Macs also helps reduce this barrier by lifting some of the hardware restrictions.<\/p><p>In May 2010, Valve released Steam for Mac OS X, and ported all of their Source games to the Mac platform by the end of 2010. Valve is hoping for the expansion of Mac gaming in the near future.<\/p><p>During the WDCC in 2014, Apple has announced their own graphics API, Metal. It allows game developers to use more hardware resources from devices using Mac OS X or <a href=\"\/iphone\/3045-96\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iOS<\/a> to gain better performance. This allows devices such as Macbooks and the <a href=\"\/ipad\/3045-121\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-121\">iPad<\/a> to run games with comparable performance to Windows PCs and consoles. Because of Metal, it was announced that Frostbite 3 is coming to Mac OS X and iOS, with its flagship title being <a href=\"\/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare\/3030-42887\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42887\">Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Linux<\/h3><p><a href=\"\/linux\/3045-152\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-152\">Linux<\/a> is a Unix-like OS licenced under the GPL. Unlike Windows and Mac OS, which require specific hardware for the OS to work properly, Linux is a software-based OS, which can be installed on a variety of devices, including devices which are not PC-based. Linux comes in various distributions, or \"distros,\" such as Ubuntu or Gentoo. Being an open source OS, the Linux community actively develops open source software, including games, for the Linux platform. However, there is no requirement that Linux software be open-source. You can get many Windows applications to work on Linux using specific Windows coding software for Linux (such as <a href=\"\/playable-via-wine\/3015-2497\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2497\">WINE<\/a>) but it is generally not a preferable way of playing Windows games compared to running them in Windows on the same machine. Furthermore, WINE is not compatible with PowerPCs including PS3s with Linux installed. A popular option for overcoming Windows compatibility issues is to multi-boot the Linux distro with a version of Windows so that both operating systems are installed on the same PC at once and the user can switch between them. In recent years, it's become more popular to run Linux in a virtual machine inside their Windows or Mac OS.<\/p><p>There has been increased development for Linux games in recent years, with many indie games, such as <a href=\"\/minecraft\/3030-30475\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30475\">Minecraft<\/a>, releasing a Linux version. The <a href=\"\/humble-bundle\/3015-6612\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6612\">Humble Indie Bundle<\/a> typically includes Linux versions of games in addition to Mac and PC. In 2012, Valve released Steam for Linux, porting all of their games to the OS along with various other games. In 2015, Valve has released SteamOS, which is installed in nearly every \"Steam box\". It is a derivative of Ubuntu that has an interface similar to Big Picture Mode that can be navigated using a controller. It allows users to stream games from another PC so users can run games that are currently not compatible with Linux. However, support for Linux gaming has been growing over the years, with many games, including indie and AAA titles, having Linux versions being released at launch.<\/p><p>The most popular Linux-based OS on the market right now is <a href=\"\/android\/3045-123\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-123\">Android<\/a>. It is a growing, open source mobile operating system with a growing gaming library. However, it is important to note that most Linux-PC applications are incompatible with Android and vice-verse (without a significant amount of effort).<\/p><h2>Components of a PC<\/h2><p>There are many replaceable parts in a PC, which is a main aspect separating them from consoles. PCs may be upgraded and maintained as time passes to keep up with the latest games, and a user's configuration will affect which games they can play. The main parts of a computer are as follows:<\/p><ul><li><b>CPU<\/b> <i>(Central Processing Unit)<\/i> - The processing unit that executes operations in a computer. It consists of an integrated circuit built of many transistors that runs on binary code. The CPU communicates with the rest of the computer through the Northbridge via a front side bus. Most medium and high end processors are 64-bit and have several cores which is known as parallel processing. The CPU creates a lot of heat and as a result requires its own dedicated heatsink or waterblock even on a low end computer.<\/li><li><b>GPU<\/b> <i>(Graphics Processing Unit)<\/i> - The dedicated graphics rendering device, very important for games. The GPU generally has its own circuit board which is slotted into the motherboard, the processing unit its self is also made up of many transistors and is heavily based on parallel processing. The GPU also uses its own dedicated RAM for storing texture data to be processed. Current generation GPUs are capable of rendering shader model 4.1 processes as part of the DirectX 11 package. Many graphics cards are also compatible with <a href=\"\/opengl\/3015-5192\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5192\">OpenGL<\/a>.<\/li><li><b>Motherboard<\/b> - The main circuit board in a PC that all the components connect to. Its through this board that all other components may communicate between each other and is run by a set of North and South bridge chipsets, though newer CPUs actually include an integrated nothrbridge.<\/li><li><b>RAM<\/b> (<i>Random Access Memory<\/i>) - Volatile dynamic memory of a system. Data can be temporarily loaded here to be accessed much faster than from the hard drive or even a solid state drive so not to slow the calculations made by the CPU. The current standard is DDR3.<\/li><li><b>PSU<\/b> <i>(Power Supply Unit)<\/i> - Supplies power to the PC. Needs to have high enough power (measured in Watts) to run all the components in the system under high load.<\/li><li><b>HDD<\/b> <i>(Hard Disk Drive)<\/i> - The main storage device of a PC.<\/li><li><strong>SSD<\/strong> <em>(Solid State Drive)<\/em> - A type of storage similar to a hard drive, but contain no moving parts. Because of this, data stored in solid state drives can be accessed and written quicker than hard drives.<\/li><li><b>Sound Card<\/b> - An expansion card that processes audio on a separate chip. Most motherboards provide integrated sound chips making sound cards an optional upgrade.<\/li><li><b>ODD<\/b> <i>(Optical Disc Drive)<\/i> - The peripheral device that reads optical discs such as DVDs, BDs, and CDs.<\/li><li><b>Case<\/b> - Houses the components.<\/li><li><b>Monitor<\/b> - The visual display unit of a computer.<\/li><li><strong>Input Devices<\/strong> - Mouse, keyboard, microphone, etc. Because of the uptake of the Xbox 360 most games from 2005 onward will work with the Xbox 360 controller. This is also helped by the fact that the Xbox 360 has a USB connection that allows game developers to easily port the control system from current console games to the PC. In 2014, Microsoft released drivers that allowed Xbox One controllers to work for all 360 controller-compatible games.<\/li><li><b>Cooling<\/b> - Commonly either water or air based. With standard cooling devices the lowest possible temperature is the ambient temperature, that of the room the system resides in. To further lower the temperature elaborate devices such as Peltier coolers, liquid gases or phase cooling may be installed, though this is best left to the extreme enthusiast due to the risk of most of these options.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Graphic Settings<\/h2><p>Unlike their console equivalents most PC games have the ability to vary the graphical settings. This feature is inherent to PCs as few systems bear the same hardware and so the user must tailor the game's settings for optimal performance and visual quality. With modern hardware PCs can often surpass their console counterparts in terms of technical graphics. Recent titles offer the option to set the ideal configuration of a game automatically. Such settings include:<\/p><ul><li><b>Resolution<\/b> - The number of pixels along the x and y axes to which the game will render.<\/li><li><b>Anti-Aliasing<\/b> - Raises the quality of the edges of polygon based models using smoothing algorithms.<\/li><li><b>Anisotropic Filtering<\/b> - Raises the quality of textures viewed from obtuse angles.<\/li><li><b>Texture Quality<\/b> - General resolution of the paint scheme of each model.<\/li><li><b>Model Quality<\/b> - General number of polygons used for each model.<\/li><li><a href=\"\/hdr-high-dynamic-range\/3015-618\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-618\"><b>High Dynamic Range lighting<\/b><\/a> - Allows for dynamic tone mapping in games.<\/li><li><b>Shader Model<\/b> - Technology a game can use to render advanced visual effects.<\/li><li><b>Vsync<\/b> - Reduces an artifact known as <i>tearing<\/i> by synchronizing the frame rate and refresh rate of the monitor.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Game Lineup<\/h2><h3>Early History<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6384\/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614050\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4320652173913\" data-width=\"368\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 368px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6384\/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-614050\"><img alt=\"Blizzard is one of the most prominent PC developers.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6384\/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6384\/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg 368w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Blizzard is one of the most prominent PC developers.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6384\/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6384\/614050-worldofwarcraftboxart.jpg 368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Blizzard is one of the most prominent PC developers.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Computers first featured simple titles similar to <a href=\"\/spacewar\/3030-21514\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21514\">SpaceWar!<\/a> or simple text-input games such as <a href=\"\/pool-of-radiance\/3030-16452\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16452\">Adventure<\/a> but have since evolved to become the leading platform for cutting-edge game development in the 21st century due to their seemingly limitless potential.<\/p><p>Old computers such as the <a href=\"\/commodore-64\/3045-14\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64<\/a> and <a href=\"\/nec-pc-9801\/3045-112\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-112\">NEC PC-98<\/a> featured a built-in controller port, for C64 controllers as well as <a href=\"\/atari-2600\/3045-40\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-40\">Atari 2600<\/a> and other controllers. Many games supported both keyboard and joystick input. Since mice have become standard, they have become the preferable method of input for many games, with various manufacturers branding mice specifically for gaming. Joysticks are still widely used via USB. Early games were simply saved onto floppy disks by a publisher or even the programmer themselves. These disks were sold in Ziploc bags and Vinyl slips; they generally had a bland manual and had nowhere near the shelf-presentation of a modern game. Modern games are distributed mainly on optical discs in hard plastic cases or cardboard boxes. There has been a large surge in digital distribution as well.<\/p><p>By the 1980s, developers such as <a href=\"\/sierra-online\/3010-2934\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2934\">Sierra Online<\/a>, <a href=\"\/origin-systems\/3010-344\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-344\">Origin Systems<\/a>, <a href=\"\/electronic-arts\/3010-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">EA<\/a>, <a href=\"\/microprose-software-inc\/3010-66\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-66\">Microprose<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc\/3010-644\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-644\">LucasArts<\/a> became some of the biggest publishers of PC games, with titles such as <a href=\"\/zork\/3025-660\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-660\">Zork<\/a>, <a href=\"\/kings-quest\/3025-413\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-413\">King's Quest<\/a>, <a href=\"\/ultima\/3030-5551\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5551\">Ultima<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/john-madden-football\/3030-1234\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1234\">John Madden Football<\/a> becoming some of the biggest titles of that era.<\/p><h3>Evolution in the 1990s<\/h3><p>In the early days of computer gaming, most games were developed by a single programmer, and were often simple <a href=\"\/games\/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=36\/\">text adventures<\/a> or downgraded ports\/clones of more powerful <a href=\"\/arcade\/3045-84\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-84\">arcade<\/a> games. PC gaming has since evolved to encompass a wide variety of genres, some faring better than others.<\/p><p>The most popular genres that have evolved on the platform are the <a href=\"\/games\/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=5\/\">CRPG<\/a> (<i>Computer Role-Playing Game<\/i>), <a href=\"\/games\/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=12\/\">RTS<\/a> <i>(<a href=\"\/real-time-combat\/3015-2332\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2332\">Real-Time<\/a> Strategy<\/i>), and <a href=\"\/games\/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=32\/\">FPS<\/a> (<em><a href=\"\/first-person-perspective\/3015-330\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">First-Person<\/a> Shooter<\/em>).<\/p><p>CRPG's were largely inspired by pen &amp; paper role playing games such as <a href=\"\/dungeons-dragons\/3025-167\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-167\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons<\/a>. The genre spans early ASCII adventures such as <a href=\"\/rogue\/3030-22309\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22309\">Rogue<\/a>, action RPG's such as <a href=\"\/dragon-slayer\/3025-783\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-783\">Dragon Slayer<\/a> and <a href=\"\/diablo\/3030-5985\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5985\">Diablo<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/games\/?sort=release_date&amp;filter_type=genre&amp;filter_value=16\/\">MMORPGs<\/a> (Massively Multiplayer Online RPGs) such as <a href=\"\/lineage\/3025-623\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-623\">Lineage<\/a> and <a href=\"\/world-of-warcraft\/3030-19783\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19783\">World of Warcraft<\/a>. Freedom is a main element that has evolved with CRPG's. The earlier games were more linear in their approach, sometimes even approaching level design from a distinct \"stages\" standpoint. CRPGs evolved to have <a href=\"\/polygonal-3d\/3015-1430\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">3D<\/a> <a href=\"\/dungeon\/3035-1131\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1131\">dungeons<\/a>, <a href=\"\/real-time-combat\/3015-2332\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2332\">real time combat<\/a>, and huge multiplayer, <a href=\"\/open-world\/3015-207\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">non-linear worlds<\/a>.<\/p><p>Real-Time Strategy games, such as <a href=\"\/starcraft\/3030-13062\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13062\">Starcraft<\/a> and <a href=\"\/command-conquer\/3030-4384\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4384\">Command &amp; Conquer<\/a>, is a genre that was at the heart of PC gaming in the 1990s and continues to remain a dominant PC genre in <a href=\"\/asia\/3035-1663\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1663\">Asian<\/a> countries like <a href=\"\/south-korea\/3035-2410\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2410\">South Korea<\/a> and <a href=\"\/china\/3035-343\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-343\">China<\/a>. The genre requires fast-paced clicking using a mouse, making implementation on consoles very difficult; ironically, the game often considered the first RTS, <a href=\"\/herzog-zwei\/3030-11439\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11439\">Herzog Zwei<\/a>, was a <a href=\"\/genesis\/3045-6\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Sega Mega Drive \/ Genesis<\/a> console game. The genre has certainly seen evolution, but the premise of collecting resources, spawning an army, and sending it into battle, has remained relatively constant throughout RTS history.

Popular digital distribution services like <a href=\"\/valve-corporation\/3010-1374\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\">Valve<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/steam\/3015-718\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam<\/a>, <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/electronic-arts\/3010-1\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1\">EA<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/origin\/3015-7040\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7040\">Origin<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/desura\/3015-6514\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6514\">Desura<\/a> helped in boosting the sales of PC games and have helped in making many indie games popular. Other digital distributors, like <a href=\"\/good-old-games\/3015-2379\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2379\">GOG<\/a>, sell older PC games that either don't sell in retail anymore or are too old to be compatible with newer operating systems. These services allow you to play older games and usually sell them for less than $10 while also being free of DRM. The <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/humble-bundle\/3015-6612\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6612\">Humble Indie Bundle<\/a> and other alternatives have been a great resource in downloading numerous indie and retail games for prices set by the end user. The majority of the proceeds go to the game developers as well as numerous charities. These type of services help in having an easy way to play PC games and having developers keep in touch with their communities.<\/p><h2>Issues<\/h2><h3>Upgrading<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650290-nvidia_fermi_class_quadro_professional_gpus_announced_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1650290\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.61487603305785\" data-width=\"605\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 605px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650290-nvidia_fermi_class_quadro_professional_gpus_announced_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1650290\"><img alt=\"NVidia's popular GeForce series of GPUs.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1650290-nvidia_fermi_class_quadro_professional_gpus_announced_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650290-nvidia_fermi_class_quadro_professional_gpus_announced_2.jpg 605w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1650290-nvidia_fermi_class_quadro_professional_gpus_announced_2.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"NVidia's popular GeForce series of GPUs.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1650290-nvidia_fermi_class_quadro_professional_gpus_announced_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650290-nvidia_fermi_class_quadro_professional_gpus_announced_2.jpg 605w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1650290-nvidia_fermi_class_quadro_professional_gpus_announced_2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>NVidia's popular GeForce series of GPUs.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>A primary issue with PC gaming is the barrier to entry due to cost. Pricing of a PC depends on what type of performance a user wants when it comes to playing games, but for people who want to play games at maximum settings, it can cost at least $1000 to build and up to $3000 to buy from a manufacturer. In order to play some of the biggest, most graphically impressive games on PC at maximum settings with a stable framerate, it may require a user to upgrade their computer components every 2-3 years. However, thanks to better optimization of games and the creation of lower level APIs such as AMD's Mantle, the barrier of entry for PC gaming has been decreasing and lower-end hardware can be used to run games with decent performance.<\/p><p>The ability to selectively upgrade hardware also gives PC gamers a flexibility absent in console gaming. Users can upgrade RAM, GPU or hard drives to make their computers more powerful as the games become more demanding. In turn, this flexibility and constant increase in performance allows developers to create games that can fully utilize the latest hardware, often leading to more complex or better looking games.<\/p><h3>Piracy and Digital Rights Management<\/h3><p>One huge problem reported by publishers with PC gaming is the excessive piracy of games. Bootleg copies of games have been a problem since the introduction of the personal computer. Many computer experts were able to copy floppy disks and distribute them to either share with friends or profit off them. Since the introduction of the internet, it has been easier to distribute pirated software than ever before (including games). Bittorrent sites make it easier for people to put up game files where everyone can download and play.<\/p><p>Although piracy ranges across the world, the areas with the most piracy are developing nations. These are areas that either have poor game distribution or have gamers that are too poor to afford many games. Piracy has also gone up since the economic crash of 2008.<\/p><p>There are many measures that game publishers use in attempts to prevent piracy. Floppy disk games of the 1980's included items in their game boxes called \"feelies\", or items necessary to have in order to play the game. Some games required the player to look in the instruction manual and type in a specific word to play the game while others had the player decrypt a code displayed on a screen using one of the items in the box. As CD games became more popular and CD copiers were gaining traction, CD keys, unique codes to identify legitimately purchased games, were introduced. Sometimes CD keys are used to access certain parts of a game such as multiplayer and Live features in <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/games-for-windows-live\/3015-2452\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2452\">Games for Windows Live<\/a> games. There have been many issues with CD keys. If you were to lose your CD key and needed to reinstall a game, you had to buy your game again. This type of security did not last long because pirates were finding ways to create fake CD keys that they could use to play pirated games. Digital Distribution has made CD keys mostly obsolete.<\/p><p>This led game publishers and various third parties to develop forms of <a href=\"\/digital-rights-management\/3015-1704\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1704\">Digital Rights Management<\/a> (DRM). DRM is digtal software protection that prevents the user from using copied game discs and downloaded disc images or installing games on multiple machines. Some early forms of DRM may interfere with some applications such as disc drive emulation software used for mounting disc images.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650293-activationfailed2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1650293\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"520\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650293-activationfailed2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1650293\"><img alt=\"Activation failure screen for GTA IV.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3661\/1650293-activationfailed2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650293-activationfailed2.jpg 520w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1650293-activationfailed2.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3661\/1650293-activationfailed2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Activation failure screen for GTA IV.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3661\/1650293-activationfailed2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3661\/1650293-activationfailed2.jpg 520w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3661\/1650293-activationfailed2.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3661\/1650293-activationfailed2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Activation failure screen for GTA IV.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>There have been controversial uses of DRM within the last few years. In 2008, <a href=\"\/ea-games\/3010-6256\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6256\">EA<\/a> announced that they are going to use a new version of <a href=\"\/securom\/3015-2720\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2720\">SecuROM<\/a> DRM that limits the number of simultaneous activated installs for all of their new PC games (starting with <a href=\"\/mass-effect\/3030-16909\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16909\">Mass Effect<\/a> and <a href=\"\/spore\/3030-14139\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14139\">Spore<\/a>). Since then there has been a huge controversy over DRM, even questioning the legality of it.<\/p><p>In 2009, <a href=\"\/ubisoft-entertainment\/3010-82\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-82\">Ubisoft<\/a> introduced a new DRM that will require you to be online at all times when playing a game. If you are disconnected from the internet for any reason, gameplay will stop. The first games to utilize the new DRM were <a href=\"\/assassins-creed-ii\/3030-22928\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22928\">Assassin's Creed II<\/a> and <a href=\"\/silent-hunter-v-battle-of-the-atlantic\/3030-28094\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28094\">Silent Hunter 5<\/a>. As of 2011, Ubisoft decided to discontinue and retool their online DRM system with the release of <a href=\"\/assassins-creed-brotherhood\/3030-31001\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31001\">Assassin's Creed Brotherhood<\/a>, and was relaunched with the release of <a href=\"\/driver-san-francisco\/3030-31634\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31634\">Driver: San Francisco<\/a>. Today, Ubisoft has their own digital platform, <a href=\"\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/uplay\/3015-4289\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4289\">Uplay<\/a>, that is needed to access many of their games.<\/p><p>Common complaints about this type of DRM are losing game progress and not being able to play when an internet connection is unavailable. Other companies are using similar DRM including EA with <a href=\"\/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight\/3030-27130\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27130\">Command and Conquer 4<\/a> and <a href=\"\/blizzard-entertainment\/3010-1088\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1088\">Blizzard<\/a> with <a href=\"\/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty\/3030-20674\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20674\">StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty<\/a> and <a href=\"\/diablo-iii\/3030-20803\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20803\">Diablo III<\/a>. Both <a href=\"\/command-conquer-4-tiberian-twilight\/3030-27130\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27130\">C&amp;C4<\/a> and <a href=\"\/diablo-iii\/3030-20803\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20803\">D3<\/a> require a constant, active connection to the host servers, but Blizzard's implementation in <a href=\"\/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty\/3030-20674\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20674\">SC2<\/a> allows offline play of the single player campaign and AI versus modes with achievement functionality disabled.<\/p><p>Recently, a new DRM method called Denuvo has been used in various games such as <a href=\"\/grand-theft-auto-v\/3030-36765\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36765\">Grand Theft Auto V<\/a>, <a href=\"\/hitman\/3030-45150\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-45150\">Hitman<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/doom\/3030-20654\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20654\">Doom<\/a> (2016). It claims to be \"uncrackable\", but there have been various cases where games have been successfully cracked.<\/p><p>Many digital distributors feature their own DRM. Steam requires users to connect to their servers at least once and enable offline mode before playing games offline. In Steam's offline mode, achievements are deactivated. Microsoft's Games For Windows Live has similar restrictions.<\/p>",

            "description": "<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>The PC-FX was an innovative Japanese console released by <a href=\"\/nec-technologies-inc\/3010-1741\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1741\"> NEC<\/a> in 1994. It is the successor to the NEC <a href=\"\/turbografx-16\/3045-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-55\"> PC-Engine<\/a>, and takes a new approach on the concept of the video game console. The PC-FX was designed to be expandable, and is even shaped like PC tower, modelled after NEC's <a href=\"\/nec-pc-9801\/3045-112\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-112\">PC-98<\/a> computer platform. The unit plays <a href=\"\/pc-fx\/3045-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-75\"> PC-FX<\/a> games, audio CDs, CD Gs, and Kodak picture CDs. Due to the consoles failing sales, NEC allowed an abundance of adult games to be released on the console. An internal PC card was available for home <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\"> PCs<\/a> that let the PC play PC-FX games so the user did not need to purchase the console. The only other console in history with this feature was <a href=\"\/matsushita-electric-corporation-of-america-panasonic\/3010-1277\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1277\"> Panasonic<\/a>'s <a href=\"\/3do\/3045-26\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-26\"> 3DO<\/a> (with the 3DO Blaster ).<\/p><h2>Hardware<\/h2><p>The case of the PC-FX is shaped like a computer and was designed to be an upgradeable console. The hardware, designed in 1992, was codenamed \"Iron Man\" and was supposed to be implemented in a new console to replace the <a href=\"\/turbografx-16\/3045-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-55\"> PC-Engine<\/a> after it was developed. PC-Engine developers were upset that <a href=\"\/nec-technologies-inc\/3010-1741\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1741\"> NEC<\/a> was releasing a new console when the market was still expanding so NEC held out another two years while continuing to support the PC-Engine. In 1994, NEC receieved pressure from <a href=\"\/3do\/3045-26\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-26\"> 3DO<\/a>, <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\"> Sega<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/sony-corporation\/3010-3223\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3223\"> Sony<\/a> with new consoles on the horizon for that year. With few options, the severely outdated Iron Man hardware was used to make the PC-FX, with the intentions of releasing a 3D expansion to compensate for the unit's underpowered graphics. Develops failed to produce titles for the underpowered system, and as a result, the lackluster game library made it unattractive to consumers. A key feature of the PC-FX is it's advanced JPEG decoding ability. It has the ability to decompress video at 30 frames per second with digital audio playing simultaneously. PC-FX games enjoyed the best <a href=\"\/full-motion-video\/3015-604\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-604\"> FMVs<\/a> in console history up until 1998 when the <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\"> Playstation<\/a> had better image quality, but still a poorer framerate. While the PC-FX could not handle 3D graphics some effects it could handle are rotation, magnification, reduction, cellophane, fade, and priority. The controller was a fairly standard 6-button controller; the console is also notable for being the first console compatible with a mouse.<\/p><p>The three expansion slots on the console are severely underused for a console marketed as being upgradable similar to a PC. An expansion slot on the front console only had one peripheral released that used it, the FX-BMP memory expansion module. It was simply a memory card that allowed players to save their data onto a portable device rather than internal memory. Expansion ports on the bottom and back of the unit were used to connect to PC-9800 computers, and let the PC-FX be used as an SCSI CD-Rom drive. The 3D expansion module was never released, nor were any upgrades and as a result, the PC-FX remained one of the least powerful consoles on the market. A small panel on the back of the console contains AV jacks, an S-Video jack, and the power connection. The PC-FX doesn't have an opening CD-Rom drive, but rather the top of the unit flips up and a CD is placed in it much like a Sega CD.<\/p><p>The PC-FX has no copy protection built into it because of the high price of CD burners and writable media at the time of release. This was fairly standard for CD-based consoles at the time.<\/p><p>The PC-FX card for PCs was available for either DOS or PC-9800. It came with 2 CDs used for PC-FX development. Unfortunately, programmed games would not work in retail consoles due to compatibility issues.<\/p><h3>Technical Specifications<\/h3><p><em>CPU <\/em>- 32-bit NEC V810 RISC processor running at 21.5MHz<\/p><p><em>Memory <\/em>- 2MB<\/p><p><em>VRAM<\/em> - 1.25MB<\/p><p><em>Back-up RAM<\/em> - 32KB<\/p><p><em>ROM <\/em>- 1MB<\/p><p><em>Video Resolution<\/em> - 640x480<\/p><p><em>Sound <\/em>- 16-bit stereo w\/2 ADPCM channels and 6 sample channels at 44.1kHz<\/p><p><em>ODD <\/em>- 2x CD-ROM drive supporting FX-CD, CD-DA, CD G, CD EG, and Photo CD<\/p><p><em>IO<\/em> - Composite, S-Video, 2 controller inputs<\/p><p><em>Expansion <\/em>- EXT1 (Back-up memory), EXT2 (Extra functions), EXT3 (Memory expansion)<\/p><p><em>Size\/Weight <\/em>- 132 x 267 x 244 mm \/ 2.9kg<\/p><p><em>Power Consumption<\/em> - 16W \/ AC 100V<\/p><h2>Software<\/h2><p>The PC-FX has somewhat of a reputation for having a higher percentage of adult titles than any other console. Due to poor sales, <a href=\"\/nec-technologies-inc\/3010-1741\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1741\"> NEC<\/a> was rather lenient with what they let be developed for the console. It launched with Graduation 2: Neo Generation FX, <a href=\"\/battle-heat\/3030-27416\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27416\"> Battle Heat<\/a> and Team Innocent in 1994. Besides hentai games and dating sims, there were also action games, strategy games, and RPGs. Being a Japanese exclusive console with a library consisting of mostly text-heavy adult games and RPGs, most games are not playable by an English speaking player. Most games do have Japanese voiceovers, for nearly all spoken text in fact, so players who have phonetically learned Japanese may be able to understand dialouge. Only 62 games ever appeared on the PC-FX.<\/p><h2>Rumored\/Unreleased Games<\/h2><h3><a href=\"\/fx-fighter\/3030-11081\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11081\"> <b> <\/b><b> FX Fighter<\/b><\/a><\/h3><p>FX Fighter was a demonstration used to promote the PC-FX and it's graphical capabilities. A demo was shown at the Tokyo Toy Show in 1994, and the game seemed playable although is unknown whether it was actually playable or an elaborate set of full motion videos. The game was a 1-on-1 3D fighter which used FMV to represent the characters movement. The game was cancelled halfway through development with only 3 or 4 characters done because the sheer size of the FMVs needed to complete the game exceeded the capacity of a single CD.<\/p><h3>Lords of Thunder FX<\/h3><p>There is little info about Lords of Thunder FX other than the fact that a tech demo existed. Some Japanese gaming magazines were shown a polygonal rendering of a boss from the original <a href=\"\/lords-of-thunder\/3030-16979\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16979\"> Lords of Thunder<\/a> released on TurboDuo. It is unknown if the released picture was a playable game, a simple rendering, or even planned for release at all.<\/p><h3>Super Star Soldier 3D<\/h3><p>Along with Lords of Thunder FX, NEC released photos of an upgraded <a href=\"\/super-star-soldier\/3030-3973\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3973\"> Super Star Soldier <\/a>supposedly on the PC-FX. There is little information about it other than that it is a Star Soldier game with better graphics. In 1994, EDGE released a single screenshot of Super Star Soldier 3D which shows the back of a 3D modelled ship flying in a 3D environment. If the shot is real, it shows that the PC-FX was capable of rendering 3D polygons in real time, but no further info on the game or 3D rendering was ever available.<\/p><h3>Hi-Ten Bomberman<\/h3><p>Hi-Ten Bombeman was originally planned for the PC-FX, and is believed to be an early version of <a href=\"\/saturn-bomberman\/3030-17854\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17854\"> Saturn Bomberman<\/a>. The game is a 10 player version of Bomberman, and is notable for being what would have been the first game formatted for wide screen HDTVs. The game was apparently near completion when NEC canceled the release due to publishing guidelines.<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/tengai-makyou-iii-namida\/3030-5171\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5171\"> <b> <\/b><b> Tengai Makyou III: NAMIDA<\/b><\/a><\/h3><p>Tengai Makyou III: NAMIDA (Far East of Eden) was a continuation of the popular Tengai Makyou RPG series. It was a highly anticipated game canceled due to the failure of the console. The game was announced in 1995 and development ceased at a very late stage. The project was not picked up again for years but <a href=\"\/hudson-entertainment-inc\/3010-419\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-419\"> Hudson<\/a> eventually released a vastly upgraded version of the game on <a href=\"\/playstation-2\/3045-19\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\"> PS2<\/a> under the same name.<\/p><h3>Masters Tournament Augusta<\/h3><p>Masters Tournament was a planned PC-FX golf game. The developed held back to see if the PC-FX would fail, and when it did, canceled the game.<\/p><h3>Pebble Beach No Hatou<\/h3><p>Pebble Beach was the planned sequel to Masters Tournament. It was ported to <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\"> Sega<\/a> <a href=\"\/saturn\/3045-42\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-42\"> Saturn<\/a> and <a href=\"\/snes\/3045-9\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\"> Super Famicom<\/a> when the developer, T&amp;E Software, saw the PC-FX would fail.<\/p><h3>Street Fight<\/h3><p>Street Fight was an <a href=\"\/full-motion-video\/3015-604\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-604\"> FMV<\/a> fighter, similar to FX FIghter but with real people. Characters with digitized and the game was supposed to be as realistic as possible. It was never released despite being shown at the 1994 Tokyo Toy Show.<\/p><h3>Robot Fighter<\/h3><p>Robot Fighter was another fighter like Street Fight and <a href=\"\/fx-fighter\/3030-11081\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11081\"> FX Fighter<\/a> which used <a href=\"\/full-motion-video\/3015-604\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-604\"> FMV<\/a> video to display two <a href=\"\/3d\/3015-1430\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\"> 3D<\/a> modeled robots fighting each other. Like the other titles, it was never released, presumably due to CD space restrictions.<\/p><h3>Sparkling Feather 2<\/h3><p>Sparkling Feather 2 was a planned sequel to Sparkling Feather, another PC-FX game. It was never released.<\/p><h3>Virtual Invaders<\/h3><p>Virtual Invaders was a <a href=\"\/space-invaders\/3030-5099\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5099\"> Space Invaders<\/a> style shooter that was scrapped early in development.<\/p>",

            "description": "<h2>Pinball History<\/h2><h3>1800s -1900<\/h3><p>Pinball can trace its origins back to the 19th century game of <a href=\"\/parlor-bagatelle-table\/3030-28752\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28752\">Bagatelle<\/a>, which became popular with American servicemen deployed in Europe. The game was primitive, compared to modern machines with no electronics and little to no mechanical features. Players hit balls with a <a href=\"\/pool-cue\/3055-1900\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1900\">cue stick<\/a> and attemped to nudge them into pockets or slots surrounded by nails or pins. Later in the 19th century inventor Montague Redgrave patented a device called a ball shooter which was similar to today pinball mechanism for releasing the ball, this which was based on the at the time recently invented steel <a href=\"\/spring\/3055-375\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-375\">spring<\/a>.<\/p><p>These machines were first popular in bars and cafes in <a href=\"\/europe\/3035-289\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-289\">Europe<\/a> and <a href=\"\/the-united-states-of-america\/3035-396\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">America<\/a>, players first exchanged money for balls to play with, then if players obtained a high enough score, they would be awarded free drinks, meals and or <a href=\"\/cigarette\/3055-311\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-311\">cigarettes<\/a>. Soon after came the introduction of the first coin-operated Bagatelle pin machines.<\/p><h3>1930s - 1950s<\/h3><p>The first coin-operated pinball machine was introduced in 1931 by Automatic Industries and was called \"Whiffle Board\". Although the gaming industry really picked up in the mid 1930's with the production of a game called <a href=\"\/ballyhoo\/3030-6858\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6858\">Ballyhoo<\/a>. It was invented by one Raymond Maloney, who later started the <a href=\"\/bally-mfg-corp\/3010-3045\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3045\">Bally Manufacturing Company<\/a> of <a href=\"\/chicago\/3035-293\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-293\">Chicago<\/a>, IL.<\/p><p>The pinball machines of this era where mainly constructed of wood with wooden legs and wooden rails on the sides of the machine.<\/p><p>It is thought the term pinball came into play at this time due to the fact that all the machines at this time had holes and pins in them. In 1933, electricity was introduced to pinball machines by adding a battery to the machine and in 1934, the first automatic scoring mechanism would appear in the form of a \"clock\" counter, as well as the first sounds in a pinball machine by way of electro-mechanical chimes, bells and buzzers. The popularity of the pinball machine rose dramatically during the mid to late 1930's in part due to the depression era and the need for low-cost entertainment for the masses.<\/p><p>Since many pinball operators in the 1930's gave away prizes based on the <a href=\"\/high-score\/3015-260\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-260\">high scores<\/a> achieved, some players tried to cheat by shaking and lifting the game, so in 1935, the tilt mechanism was invented by Harry Williams, founder of the famous <a href=\"\/williams-electronic-games-inc\/3010-3243\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3243\">Williams Manufacturing Company<\/a>, this mechanism determined how hard the table was tilted or shook to stop players trying to control the game to their advantage. Modern day pinball machines employ two such tilt devices, one that measures the movement of the game side to side, and another called the slam tilt that is used to movement up and down and prevents such acts as slamming your hand into the machine or trying to lift and drop the machine.<\/p><h3>1950s - 1990s<\/h3><p>Pinball machines grew in popularity after <a href=\"\/world-war-ii\/3015-471\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-471\">World War II<\/a>. The ten year period of 1948-58 is referred to by some as the Golden Age of pinball, due to the invention of flippers in 1947 by the <a href=\"\/gottlieb\/3010-524\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-524\">D. Gottlieb Co.<\/a> in a game called \" <a href=\"\/humpty-dumpty\/3030-28674\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28674\">Humpty Dumpty<\/a>\", and was one of the main reasons for the renewed interest in pinballs at the time.<\/p><p>In 1948, a firm called Genco placed one set of flippers at the very bottom of the playfield in a machine called \" <a href=\"\/triple-action\/3030-10262\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10262\">Triple Action<\/a>\" - But the setup was still a little unusual by today's standards; the flippers were facing outwards, not inwards like today's models.<\/p><p>The first game that had a modern flipper arrangement was the <a href=\"\/spot-bowler\/3030-28807\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-28807\">Spot Bowler<\/a>, a 1950's D. Gottlieb Co. machine. It was not until the mid 70's that most pinball machines adopted the longer 3 inch flippers we play with on today's modern machines.<\/p><p>It was also in the mid 70's that solid-state electronic pinball machines were first introduced, starting yet another huge wave of public popularity due to new games innovations, features, Game reliability and cool design features like electronic scoring, alphanumeric scoring, electronic sounds and finally electronic speech, which lasted well into the late 80's.<\/p><p>The late 80's saw <a href=\"\/williams-electronic-games-inc\/3010-3243\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3243\">Williams<\/a> and <a href=\"\/bally-mfg-corp\/3010-3045\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3045\">Bally<\/a> merge to become the main pinball manufacturers in the market, and in the 90's they both produced some of the most amazing pinball machines concepts ever dreamed of like <a href=\"\/medieval-madness\/3030-24687\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24687\">Medieval Madness<\/a>, <a href=\"\/cirqus-voltaire\/3030-22732\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22732\">Cirqus Voltaire<\/a>, <a href=\"\/twilight-zone\/3030-22731\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22731\">Twilight Zone<\/a>, <a href=\"\/theatre-of-magic\/3030-27346\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27346\">Theatre Of Magic<\/a>, <a href=\"\/monster-bash\/3030-14374\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14374\">Monster Bash<\/a>, <a href=\"\/scared-stiff\/3030-35196\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35196\">Scared Stiff<\/a>, <a href=\"\/tales-of-the-arabian-nights\/3030-35197\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35197\">Tales Of The Arabian Nights<\/a> and the most popular pinball machine in modern history, <a href=\"\/the-addams-family\/3030-22525\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22525\">Addams Family<\/a> (with over 20,000 produced), along with many other modern-day collectible classics, and finally the last pinball machines of the golden era of pinball manufacturers, <a href=\"\/cactus-canyon\/3030-35182\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35182\">Cactus Canyon<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/pinball-2000\/3030-17913\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17913\">Pinball 2000<\/a> machines, which combined video movies over standard pinball action.<\/p><p>After hitting peak popularity in the early 1990s, interest in pinball began to decline, with Capcom and Gottlieb shuttering their doors in the mid- to late 1990s, and ultimately with the shuttering of the pinball division at Bally\/Williams.<\/p><p> <\/p><h3>Currently<\/h3><p>Pinball has experienced yet another resurgence in popularity, with a strong collectors' market, as well as new venues for pinball opening up across the United States and the rest of the world. Competitive pinball has also enjoyed a resurgence, with over 100 leagues regularly meeting across the world, and membership rising from just 500 active players worldwide in 2006 to over 27,000 active players worldwide in late 2014.<\/p><p>There are currently several companies currently producing commercial pinball machines.<\/p><p><a href=\"\/stern-pinball\/3010-2694\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2694\">Stern Pinball, Inc.<\/a> (formerly <a href=\"\/stern-electronics-inc\/3010-2694\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2694\">Stern Electronics, Inc.<\/a>) weathered the crash of the late 1990s and early 2000s, for a time existing as the only producer of pinball machines. Stern primarily focuses upon licensed properties, including The Walking Dead, AC\/DC, Metallica, Lord of the Rings, Spider-Man, and Star Trek.

            "description": "<h2>Overview<\/h2><p>The Pioneer LaserActive was a high-end video player and game console released in 1993. It played LaserDiscs, LaserActive games, and had add-on support for <a href=\"\/genesis\/3045-6\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Genesis <\/a>and <a href=\"\/turbografx-16\/3045-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-55\">TurboGrafx-16 <\/a>games. The LaserActive was hyped to compete with the <a href=\"\/3do\/3045-26\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-26\">3DO <\/a>at the huge MSRP of $969.99. At CES in 1993, the 3DO was on display but the LaserActive was displayed at an invite-only event and hype died for the console a few months before its September release. Quite notable about LaserActive, besides the unsightly price tag, was the fact that the Genesis and TurboGrafx-16 add-ons were actually developed jointly with <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega <\/a>and <a href=\"\/nec-technologies-inc\/3010-1741\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1741\">NEC<\/a>. In previous eras of gaming, similar pirated adapters would be released that were both unauthorized and illegal.<\/p><h2>Hardware<\/h2><p>The Pioneer CLD-A100 was the only LaserActive model (besides the <a href=\"\/nec-technologies-inc\/3010-1741\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1741\">NEC <\/a>PDE-LD1, which was a clone). It played regular laserdiscs as well as LaserActive games which were 540Mb LD-ROM laserdiscs. It is the second most expensive console ever released, with an MSRP of $969.99 and expansions (called PACs) going for around $599.99 (The most expensive console ever was the <a href=\"\/rdi-halcyon\/3045-107\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-107\">RDI Halcyon <\/a>which retailed for $2,500). The console has a large, motorized tray in the front that accepts 12\" laserdiscs as well as a smaller door for 5\" CDs. The bottom of the unit has a large expansion slot for the <a href=\"\/sega\/3010-62\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega<\/a>, NEC, and Karaoke modules produced. Locking mechanisms were used to prevent a game from being ejected while in use. The system came with a remote, but no controller. The controllers were bundled with the PACs.<\/p><p>A LaserActive with both the Sega and NEC PACs can play around 1,500 games, but only a dozen or so laserdisc games were ever released exclusively for the console. LaserActive games were graphically and audibly superior to games that came out around the same time, but due to the format it lacked the precise controls of competing consoles. The discs held 540Mb worth of code for the game but the LaserActive software could store over 100,000 still images and an hour of audio in addition to that, making it hard to compete with audibly and visually.<\/p><p>The LaserActive weighs in at 25lbs and measures 6x17x15\".<\/p><h3><a href=\"\/3-d-glasses\/3055-1919\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1919\"> 3D Glasses<\/a><\/h3><p>3D glasses were available for the LaserActive called the LaserActive 3-D Goggles; <em>GOL-1. <\/em>A required adapter, the <em>ADP-1<\/em>, was necessary to use them. The adapter allowed two sets of glasses to be connected. Many LaserActive games supported the goggles. They are extraordinarily rare today.<\/p><h2>PACs<\/h2><p>The add on components were referred to as PACs by <a href=\"\/pioneer-productions\/3010-845\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-845\">Pioneer<\/a>. They were inserted into the single expansion slot in the lower part of the console and look similar to modern day optical disk or floppy disk drives. The base console itself could only play laserdisc movies, thus a PAC was required even to play Laseractive games. To make matters worse each Laseractive game could only be played on a specific PAC. If a consumer wanted to play all the games specifically built for the system but didn't care about either Genesis or Turbografix games than they still would of had to buy both. <\/p><h3>Sega PAC<\/h3><p>The Sega PAC, <em>PAC-S10<\/em>, allows the LaserActive to play 8\" and 12\" Mega LD discs, as well as existing <a href=\"\/genesis\/3045-6\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-6\">Genesis <\/a>and even <a href=\"\/sega-cd\/3045-29\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-29\">Sega CD <\/a>games. Mega LD discs were loaded with MPEG-1 FMV backgrounds used in conjunction with Genesis or Sega CD games. The 2d sprites from the Genesis games would be pasted on the motion background from the laserdisc. The PAC has 2 Genesis controller ports on the front and included a Pioneer branded 6-button Genesis controller. It also included a Mega LD called <a href=\"\/pyramid-patrol\/3030-20791\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20791\">Pyramid Patrol<\/a>, and a Sega CD compilation disc featuring <a href=\"\/streets-of-rage\/3030-20436\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20436\">Streets of Rage<\/a>, <a href=\"\/the-revenge-of-shinobi\/3030-236\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-236\">Revenge of Shinobi<\/a>, <a href=\"\/columns\/3030-5487\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5487\">Columns <\/a>and <a href=\"\/golden-axe\/3030-14351\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14351\">Golden Axe<\/a>. The Sega PAC was so popular that more than half of US LaserActive owners purchased this add-on for $599.99. About 20 LD-ROM games were released for the Sega PAC.<\/p><h3>NEC PAC<\/h3><p>The NEC PAC, PAC-N10, allowed the LaserActive to play HuCards, Super CD-ROMs, and LD-ROM^2 discs. It came with a 2 button controller and an LD-ROM^2 that included the same games that came with a NEC TurboDuo (<a href=\"\/gate-of-thunder\/3030-20937\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20937\">Gate of Thunder<\/a>, <a href=\"\/bonks-adventure\/3030-6973\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6973\">Bonk's Adventure<\/a>, <a href=\"\/bonks-revenge\/3030-8670\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8670\">Bonk's Revenge <\/a>and <a href=\"\/bomberman\/3030-2430\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2430\">Bomberman<\/a>). It also came with an educational game named Econosaurus that used the LD-ROM^2 format. The device is region locked, so it will not play PC-Engine games on a US console. It retailed for $599.99, the same price as the Sega PAC, but was much more poorly received. It is widely sought after due to its rarity.<\/p><p>Nine games were released on LD-ROM^2 for the NEC PAC.<\/p><h3>Karaoke PAC<\/h3><p>The Karaoke PAC, PAC-K10, was a novel concept for gaming consoles at the time. It allowed the system to play all LaserKaraoke titles and sing along to music videos. The PAC included a microphone and features 2 mic inputs with separate volume controls, and a tone control. It was compatible with about 200 karaoke titles and, like the other PACs, was region locked. It retailed for $349.99.<\/p><h3>Computer Interface PAC<\/h3><p>The Computer Interface PAC, PAC-C1<em>, <\/em>allows remote control of the LaserActive via a 25-pin serial port where it can be hooked up to a PC or Mac. It came with a 33-button remote to replace the included 24-button one. The PAC included software to create LaserActive software called LaserActive Program Editor<em>. <\/em>On the bundled floppies were example programs that interacted with <a href=\"\/tenchi-muyo\/3025-1385\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1385\">Tenchi-Muyo! <\/a>laserdiscs.<\/p><h2>Market Failure<\/h2><p>The LaserActive is a very innovative device; not many consoles are able to play as wide a variety of games as it can. It failed due to an outrageous price as well as very poor marketing and managed to sell merely 10,000 units. At the Consumer Electronics Show in 1993, Pioneer inexplicably showcased the hardware behind closed doors. The reasons for this were unknown and the <a href=\"\/3do\/3045-26\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-26\">3DO <\/a>took center stage. When the console was released in September 1993, not enough consumers had heard about it or cared about it. The price tag was almost impossible to justify at $969.99, and PACs costing $599.99. A Sega Genesis was $229.99 at the time and a Sega CD $89.99. That's about half the price of what the Sega PAC cost, in addition to nearly $1000 for the LaserActive itself. Most gamers ignored the NEC add-on due to the lack of notable software releases.<\/p><p>In addition to the fact that the PACs cost more than their respective console equivalents, the LaserActive wasn't an extraordinary laserdisc player for the high end AV market. It did not have a jog dial or a digital display. The software library of Mega-LD and LD-ROM^2 titles is too small to even mention. The system launched to an audience that didn't receive it and died out to the 3DO in 1994.<\/p>",

            "description": "<h2>Overview<br \/><\/h2>The Pippin was a computer entertainment platform developed by Apple Computers and manufactured by Bandai co. The Pippin was based on the hardware and software architecture of the second generation Power Macintosh. It was intended to not only be a video game console, but also a complete multimedia experience. It could play music CDs and other non-game software titles. It was meant to be an advanced multimedia PC that was easy to use and affordable for most households. Since most homes had a television set in the home already, Apple believed that people would be willing to invest in a low cost computer that connected to equipment that was already present in the home. The Pippin was made a platform that Apple made available to third party manufacturers under license, similar to the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. The only manufacturers that made Pippins were Bandai in Japan and the United States, and Katz Media in Europe. The Pippin lasted only two years, and ceased production in 1997. It is widely regarded as a failure.<br \/><br \/><h2>Software<\/h2>Only 18 titles were released for the Pippin in the United States, although Bandai released as many as 80 in Japan. All Pippin titles could be used on Macintosh computers of the time, although you could not use any Macintosh software on the Pippin without certain modifications. Through heavy modification, some DOS and Windows based programs could also be used on the Pippin.<br \/><br \/><h2>Hardware<\/h2>The Pippin units released in Japan were white colored and were called ATMARK units. The Pippins released in the United States were black and were called @WORLD units. Both units were compatible with numerous accessories, including floppy disk drives and printers.
