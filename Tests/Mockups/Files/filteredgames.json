This is a shift from the turn-based combat BioWare has dealt with extensively, to a third-person shooter with a cover system, a first for the company. Conversations are carried out via dialogue trees on <i>Mass Effect<\/i>'s \"conversation wheel\", which instead of telling you exactly the line you character will deliver, gives the general gist and tone of your response, in an attempt to make conversations flow better. However, you can wait as long as you want to choose a response after the other person is done talking, with no difference in the dialogue or reaction from the <a href=\"\/non-player-character\/3015-967\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPCs<\/a>. Occasionally, a dialogue tree option will appear red or blue, which means it requires a certain skill level in either charm (blue) or intimidate (red) to unlock that dialogue option. Pressing the correct button while someone is talking (\"X\" on the Xbox 360 version) will interrupt their line with yours, but they will not react to being interrupted. It is a function to speed up the pace of the dialogue, or skip over it entirely if you have already heard it before.<\/p><p>Combat is third-person, gun based, with <a href=\"\/biotics\/3015-4299\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4299\">biotic<\/a> abilities (comparable to Force Powers form the <i>KotOR<\/i> games). Combat is set in real time, although you may pause the game and select a power or readjust your aim at any time by holding the designated key or button. This brings up a <a href=\"\/radial-menu\/3015-737\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-737\">circle menu<\/a> listing the powers of you and your two squad-mates. You can choose any power from any party member currently in your squad to queue up from this radial menu, and your teammates will use it when you resume the game. The cover system works by simply going up to a wall (high or low) you wish to hide behind. Shepard automatically takes cover and you can move left and right and shoot over the cover (if you are crouching behind something) or around it.<\/p><p>There are a number of choices in the options menu relating to your AI squadmates determining how frequently they use their abilities. The strictest of these requires the player to individually command the AI to use an ability, whereas the loosest allows your teammates to use abilities whenever they are available. Both of these have their own advantages and disadvantages, and it is left to the player to decide which option best suits their own style of gameplay.<\/p><p>The player has a pool of six companions, two of which can be chosen to accompany Shepard on any venture outside your flagship, the SSV Normandy. There is one character of each class as described below, giving the player a variety of options when it comes to combat. These teammates can be controlled using the D-pad, where each direction corresponds to a squad command. Up directs your squad to move to a certain location, down tells them to hold position and take cover if under fire, left orders them to regroup on you, and right tells them to attack a specific enemy.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/56\/232363-masseffect_pc_25_1280x760.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-232363\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.59375\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/56\/232363-masseffect_pc_25_1280x760.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-232363\"><img alt=\"Exploring a planet\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/56\/232363-masseffect_pc_25_1280x760.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/56\/232363-masseffect_pc_25_1280x760.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/56\/232363-masseffect_pc_25_1280x760.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/56\/232363-masseffect_pc_25_1280x760.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/56\/232363-masseffect_pc_25_1280x760.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Exploring a planet\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/56\/232363-masseffect_pc_25_1280x760.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/56\/232363-masseffect_pc_25_1280x760.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/56\/232363-masseffect_pc_25_1280x760.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/56\/232363-masseffect_pc_25_1280x760.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/56\/232363-masseffect_pc_25_1280x760.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Exploring a planet<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In the true spirit of open-world RPGs, the player can choose where to go via an appropriately futuristic galaxy map. There are multiple star clusters available to travel to, each with one or more smaller systems inside it. Each of these systems has its own planets in orbit around a sun, and they player is free to use the galaxy map to explore each of these worlds. Every single world has an individual description, and the majority can be surveyed at the push of a button, which allows the player to find (for example) rare minerals, or ancient artifacts, which are used to complete side quests. One planet in each system can also be manually explored by the player, which takes place via a vehicle called the Mako.<\/p><h2>Classes (Shepard)<\/h2><p>Players can choose from six different classes for Commander Shepard, each focusing on a different set of abilities for use in combat situations. These abilities are split into three categories:<\/p><ul><li><p><b>Combat<\/b> - Focused on weapon efficiency and physical fitness.

When Shepard arrives in the briefing room, Captain Anderson informs him\/her that the Normandy is actually being sent to Eden Prime to recover what seems to be an ancient Prothean artifact. Nihlus, who is also present, reveals that, in addition to helping with the recovery of the artifact, he will also be evaluating Shepard. On this and several more missions, he will determine whether or not he\/she has the skills for induction into the Spectres, the elite shadow operatives under the Citadel Council. The political implications of such a placement would bolster humanity's status into one of the elite races within Citadel space.

Elsewhere, Nihlus encounters his friend and mentor, a turian Spectre named Saren Arterius. Relieved to see a familiar face, Nihlus lets his guard down and confesses to Saren that he is confused about the proceedings on Eden Prime, and why Saren is here. Saren calmly explains that he was sent to help him and, when Nihlus turns his back to him, Saren shoots him the head.<\/p><p>Shepard, Alenko, and Williams continue to search for the beacon, which leads them to tram station leading to the docks, and Nihlus' corpse. On their approach, the massive ship, Sovereign, is seen taking off. They discover a dockworker who was hiding behind a crate and after a brief interrogation they learn Nihlus' fate. Shortly there after they defuse several charges intended to eliminate all evidence of the geth invasion, and Shepard manages to find the beacon. The team member whose gender is the opposite of Shepard's approaches the beacon, and it begins to pull them forcibly towards it. Shepard leaps to the rescue, and consequently is lifted into the air. The beacon imprints on his\/her mind a confusing and fragmented vision. After this brief succession of images, the beacon explodes, and knocks Shepard unconscious.<\/p><p><b>Citadel<\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929845-citadel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-929845\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.55\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929845-citadel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-929845\"><img alt=\"Concept Art\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929845-citadel.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929845-citadel.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/2\/22518\/929845-citadel.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/22518\/929845-citadel.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929845-citadel.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Concept Art\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929845-citadel.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929845-citadel.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/2\/22518\/929845-citadel.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/22518\/929845-citadel.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929845-citadel.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Concept Art<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Shepard regains consciousness in the Normandy's infirmary.

In it, Saren's conversation with an unidentified person, possibly female, reveals his involvement in Eden Prime. As well, a cryptic reference to 'the Conduit' and the return of the Reapers is mentioned. The humans take this new evidence to the council. The evidence gives the edge required to sway the council. Saren is found guilty, his Spectre status is revoked, and he is named an enemy to the Citadel. Udina demands that the Citadel send its fleets after him to track him down. However, the council denies the request, pointing out that a fleet cannot track a single person, as well as the political implications of such an act (a war with a number of rogue systems). Shepard volunteers to go after Saren, if he\/she were given the authority. The turian representative opposes the move, saying that humanity is not ready for this honor. Shepard points out that it was a turian who broke the law. He relents and the Citadel Council appoints Shepard Spectre status, a first for humanity.

Meanwhile, Jeong has reestablished contact with Exo-Geni and has orders to purge the place. The player can either talk him down if his charm skills are high enough, or threaten him. Alternatively, the player can shoot Jeong in the head and kill him instantly. The player also learns that the Thorian is controlling the colonists and that using a simple anti-Thorian gas will temporarily paralyze them and allows Shepard to continue unhindered. It is the player\u2019s choice, but regardless, Shepard battles his way to the freighter that is near the heart of the city. There, he encounters the colony leader as he is struggling with the Thorian for control of his mind; it seems that the Thorian has ordered him to kill Shepard for his transgression but he ends up shooting himself in the head, then saying that he is free now. The player goes on to move the freighter and descends a stairway. There he spots an massive plant-like creature that spans many levels, after approaching it the Thorian \"secrets\" an asari who claims to speak to him.

An asari bursts free and thanks the player, although she confesses that she wished the Player had not killed the Thorian. Shepard asks her questions about Saren and the Conduit and she agrees to him the \"cipher\". It will help the player better make sense of the images. She also gives her back-story about how her along with Benezia went to Saren to try and guide him down a gentle path. However, on Sovereign, he was all but unstoppable as the ship had an effect on all of them. Soon they found themselves allying with Saren and executing his plans. It is the players choice whether he kill the asari for her transgressions or let her go so that she can help the colonists that she had harmed.<\/p><p>If the player completed the optional side quests, then you will find that the power, water, and food is restored to the colony.

If you had done the previous side quest for the doctor then you can use the garage pass he gives you to sneak through the back of the facility and face Benezia. However, if you did not do the optional side quest, you have to go back through the facility. Ventralis and his men inside inform you that they have orders from Benezia to kill you, and attempt to do so.<\/p><p>After defeating them, you continue through the station. You encounter and defeat numerous other geth and humans, then come face to face with Benezia, who is standing on an elevated platform near a glass tank that harbors the Rachni Queen. Even if the player has Liara in the party, Benezia will not be dissuaded, she mocks Shepard and launches wave of wave of deadly asari commandos who are backed up by the geth. After the player fights though waves of these enemies, he can finally engage Benezia. She temporarily weakens and in her moment of weakness, she pleads with you to listen to her. She too talks about Sovereign\u2019s indoctrination powers and claims that she had no control over her actions once she fell into its vice. She also informs you that the reason that she came to the facility was so that she could extract the location of the Mu Relay, which has gotten \u201clost\u201d after a star that was nearby went supernova.<\/p><p>However, the Rachni found the relay and since the memories of the Queen are carried onto other Queens, he forced the information out of the Rachni. She confesses that she was not gentle and if Liara is present in the party, lets her know how proud of her she is. She once again loses control and Shepard is forced to put her down for good. Once she is dead, one of the other asari that was near her is reanimated, Shepard and the rest of the squad look on cautiously as she speaks, however it is the Rachni queen that is talking. The queen explains that she can use people temporarily when they are either unconscious or close to dying. She asks you what you will do to her, whether you would condemn her to the same fate as the rest of her species or if you would give her a chance and set her free. She claims that because she had no part in the War, she can be neutral and promises that she desires nothing more than peace. If Wrex is in the party he is extremely annoyed at this and points out that millions of his people died to put down the menace. However, the other person in your party interjects and says that you will be committing genocide if you do kill her. If you decide to kill her, she pleads with you once more and if you still do not listen she will look helplessly as you fill the tank with acid and thereby kill her. However, if you do free her she promises you that she will remember your kindness and will sing \u201csongs\u201d about you. If you have Wrex in the party he will slyly comment \u201cGreat, Bugs are writing songs about you, Shepard\u201d. Regardless of you choice, your mission in Noveria will come to an end.<\/p><h3>Normandy<\/h3><p>You will have pieced together another piece of the puzzle; that the Mu <a href=\"\/mass-relay\/3055-1181\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1181\">Mass relay<\/a> will lead to a planet and that is somehow related to the return of the mysterious <a href=\"\/the-reapers\/3015-742\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-742\">Reapers<\/a>. After you make your report to the <a href=\"\/the-citadel\/3035-26\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-26\">Citadel<\/a>, you are informed that there is an Infiltration team on Virmire that has sent an emergency transmission and that the council believes that it has something to do with Saren. They also inform you that they have lost contact with the team on Virmire and have very limited data on the ground conditions.<\/p><h3>Virmire<\/h3><p>Once the player gets to <a href=\"\/virmire\/3035-850\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-850\">Virmire<\/a> and enters orbit, <a href=\"\/jeff-joker-moreau\/3005-3218\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3218\">Joker<\/a> informs you that there are a lot of anti-aircraft turrets and that you will have to take the MAKO and shut the turrets down. You are dropped in a little river of sorts and in addition to some harmless local wildlife, the place is overrun with geth. They are there in force and include armor units, like the monstrous Colossus. After fighting through a plentitude of enemies, you reach the first barrier of sorts, which has controls to the anti-aircraft barricade. After you disengage another turret, the Normandy is free to land. You are also informed that there is a Salarian encampment a few clicks from your position, and you precede there. As you reach the encampment, you are greeted by a Salarian named Captain Kirahee. He informs you that he is part of the STG (Special Tactics Group) and that he is here to take stalk of the situation.<\/p><p>He looks shocked to see that you have only brought a small crew, and he tells you that he requested for the Citadel to send a fleet. He goes on to tell you that Virmire houses Saren\u2019s main medical base and that he aims to develop a cure for the Genophage. He also tells you that the Base must be destroyed so that the krogan are not unleashed again. If you agreed at the Citadel to take Wrex aboard, he makes an appearance and warningly tells you that the krogan are not a mistake before angrily stalking away. Captain Kirahee looks extremely perturbed by Wrex and asks you if you can deal with him, and make sure things don\u2019t get out of hand.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929839-mass_effect_virmire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-929839\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929839-mass_effect_virmire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-929839\"><img alt=\"Virmire\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929839-mass_effect_virmire.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929839-mass_effect_virmire.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/2\/22518\/929839-mass_effect_virmire.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/22518\/929839-mass_effect_virmire.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929839-mass_effect_virmire.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Virmire\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929839-mass_effect_virmire.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929839-mass_effect_virmire.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/2\/22518\/929839-mass_effect_virmire.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/22518\/929839-mass_effect_virmire.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929839-mass_effect_virmire.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Virmire<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>You tell him that you will do so, and go to confront Wrex, who is busy trying to shoot down birds. Immediately upon entering into the conversation, Wrex accuses you of not giving back to him, and points out that he has stuck behind Shepard in every instance. If your charm\/intimidate skills are high enough, you can convince him to stand down. If you use the charm action you can point out tactfully that the krogan are not really a part of his race, as they work for Saren, who is using them as cannon fodder. Alternatively, if you choose to use intimidate, you can drive home that point more bluntly. However, if your charm\/intimidate skills are not high enough, Wrex must be killed. You can do this in one of two ways: You can signal Ashley to shoot him from afar, or you can shoot him yourself. Otherwise when the conversation starts going south, Ashley will kill him without your consent, saying that it's better that Wrex dies than you, Shepard.<\/p><p>After this confrontation, you go and talk to Captain Kirahee, who gives an uplifting speech to his men, and informs you of his plan to attack the facility. This plot involves splitting the troops into two squads, with Kirahee's main force directly attacking the facility, which will almost certainly end in death. He says that this diversion will allow Shepard's smaller squad to infiltrate the facility through the less fortified back entrance. He asks for one of your squad mates, either Kaiden Alenko or Ashely Williams to join his team. He reasons that this would improve communication between the squads. Along the way, he advises you to look for opportunities to undermine the geth operations in the area, such as knocking down communication towers and such. After you decide on either Kaiden or Ashley, you proceed with the mission.<\/p><p>It is immediately clear that Capt. Kirahee\u2019s distraction has succeeded as you face a very small contingent of enemy forces. You will enter the facility through the backside, so to speak, and you have to work your way to the middle-front of the facility to reach the main lab section. Eventually, after wading through geth and krogan forces, you will reach a holding area staffed by mindless Salarians, the same who were part of Captain Kirahees STG commandos group. In fact, if you talk to him before you start the mission; he tells you that he sent out scouts who did not return. After you kill them, you will have the choice of taking a elevator up to the labs, or proceeding through another door. Captain Kirahee's distraction should give you a clean shot at the base There, you will encounter another Salarian, who seems hell-bent on getting out of his holding facility. He tells you that he hears an incessant noise coming though the cell wall. If you have Wrex or Ashley in the party they will advise you not to let him out. Either way, he will freak out and end up knocking himself out by running into the cell door. After, you take the elevator up to the labs and are promptly encountered by a multitude of krogan and geth. The lab area is large, and you will have to work your way through the facility.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929840-virmire2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-929840\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929840-virmire2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-929840\"><img alt=\"River to Virmire Base\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929840-virmire2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929840-virmire2.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/2\/22518\/929840-virmire2.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/22518\/929840-virmire2.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929840-virmire2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"River to Virmire Base\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929840-virmire2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929840-virmire2.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/2\/22518\/929840-virmire2.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/22518\/929840-virmire2.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929840-virmire2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>River to Virmire Base<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Of note is the fact that the organics in the facility are genuinely immersed in their work; on one occasion, a krogan will come running to face you, shouting about how the work benefits his race and that he will not let you destroy it. They almost seem a little mad. After you succeed in destroying everything in the facility, you proceed through a door to further reaches of the facility. Also, Captain Kirahee and the rest of the main squad warns you that they are under heavy attack and have taken casualties. As you make your way through the facility you will run across an asari doctor who has barricaded herself in an office. She will beg you not to kill her and offers to trade information for her life. She makes a startling revelation that Saren\u2019s ship has the power to completely indoctrinate living beings, and that if this process is repeated long enough, said organisms are lobotomized.<\/p><p>In addition, she says that Saren constructed the medical facility in the hope that he could uncover a way to nullify and protect himself from the mind controlling powers of Sovereign. She also informs you that the outlook on nearly every organic on the medical facility is bleak, as they have either been killed or completely lobotomized by Sovereign. She also tells you that she can give you a pass card to Saren\u2019s personal office if you spare her. If you choose to kill her as punishment for her crimes, she will attempt to run away, but be shot in the back by Shepard. Alternatively, if you let her live, you will take the pass card from her and tell her to evacuate because you plan to blow the station once you are done. Regardless of your choice, you enter Saren\u2019s lab and you notice that there is another Prothean beacon... similar to the one that you found on Eden prime in your first mission.<\/p><p>After you activate it, you are shown more of the same in the sense that the vision that you saw earlier is replayed but with somewhat of a better quality. In the vision, you are able to make out people screaming in the distance and horrible distorted figures on their knees almost as if they are begging for their lives. After you view the beacon, you notice that there is another Holographic station on the upper level and you proceed to activate it. In one of the most enigmatic twists in the game, you are greeted with an image of what looks to be almost a long eight legged creature... it is in fact, Sovereign, which is Saren\u2019s ship. The player is presented with an opportunity to ask a multitude of questions, regarding the reapers and Sovereign itself.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929841-virmire3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-929841\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929841-virmire3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-929841\"><img alt=\"Shepard, Kaidan, Ashley\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929841-virmire3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929841-virmire3.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/2\/22518\/929841-virmire3.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/22518\/929841-virmire3.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929841-virmire3.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Shepard, Kaidan, Ashley\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929841-virmire3.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22518\/929841-virmire3.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/2\/22518\/929841-virmire3.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/22518\/929841-virmire3.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22518\/929841-virmire3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Shepard, Kaidan, Ashley<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Sovereign reveals that the Reapers, originally created the Citadel and mass relays, as well as the majority of the \u2018Prothean\u2019 legacy. This technology was purposely left behind so that galactic society would follow paths that the Reapers could anticipate. \"<em>I am the vanguard of your destruction<\/em>.\" It tells Shepard that a massive Reaper fleet is awaiting Sovereign's activation of the mass relays in order to wreak havoc and destruction upon the entire galaxy. It informs the player that the Reapers have repeated this process for millions of years; wiping the galaxy clean of sentient organic life once every 50,000 years and retreating to dark space. Sovereign holds the organic races of the galaxy in low regard as it says that itself and its fellow Reapers are the pinnacle of technological advancement and cannot be surpassed in any shape or form. It views the geth as nothing more than tools to reach its end goal, and finds their worship to be pitiful. It is implied that Sovereign is the true enemy and that Saren, like so many others, is just a pawn in Sovereign\u2019s scheme. When asked for a motivation for its actions, it merely responds that its reasoning would be beyond the comprehension of an organic being such as Shepard. He then cuts off the transmission after claiming that there is nothing more to be said. Shepard receives a transmission from Joker that Sovereign just pulled a 180-degree turn, and was headed back for Virmire.<\/p><p>The strike team rushes out of the room, blasting geth as they go, and race to the anti-air tower, which they take out while Captain Kirrahe's team destroys their target. Shepard and his crew arrive at the bomb spot, and Joker flies the Normandy into the compound, delivering the bomb. However, while the bomb is being armed, Shepard recieves a transmission from Kirrahe's team that they are pinned down by the AA tower. Shepard and team set out to save them, but halfway there they get word from the bombsite that geth reinforcements are pouring in, and they can't hold them off. Shepard is faced with a choice to rescue either the team with Kirrahe, or the team at the bomb. One party member is at each location, and Shepard can't rescue both.<\/p><p>The player is presented with a choice of who to save here. Whichever party member is not saved will remain at their post and try to hold off the geth for as long as possible. After Shepard saves the team member Shepard chose to, Saren arrives. The two have a brief fight, and Saren reveals his motives to Shepard, thinking that he will save the galaxy by siding with Sovereign. Shepard defeats Saren in their confrontation, but Saren narrowly escapes. Joker arrives to pick up the survivors of the assault, and the Normandy escapes to orbit as the nuclear device detonates on Virmire, creating a giant explosion visible from orbit, which kills whomever Shepard did not save.<\/p><h3>Mutiny on the Normandy<\/h3><p>Thanks to the undamaged beacon on Virmire, Shepard's Prothean vision is now complete. During the debrief, Liara touches Shepard's mind to interpret it fully. The vision was a distress call intended to warn the Protheans about the Reapers. Liara realises that the landmarks in the vision are on Ilos a planet she has studied as part of her Prothean research. Ilos had been impossible to reach because it was only accessible through the Mu Relay, which is why Saren needed the Relay's location from Noveria. After the debrief, Joker has a message for Shepard from the Council: they're putting together a massive multi-species effort to face Saren.<\/p><p>Thrilled the Council are finally taking this seriously, Shepard returns to the Citadel, wanting to personally lead the assault. But once back at the station, Shepard discovers the Council are only putting up a blockade around the Mass Relays to stop Saren reaching the Citadel. Neither they nor Ambassador Udina believe Shepard's story about the Reapers and they refuse to send a fleet to Ilos. The Mu Relay is in the Terminus Systems and a Citadel fleet there could start a war. Shepard knows the Normandy's stealth systems can get them there discreetly, but the Council are getting tired of Shepard's insistence that the Reapers are the real threat. Udina, wanting to make nice with the Council, locks out the Normandy's systems and grounds the ship.<\/p><p>Frustrated, knowing Saren is close to finding the Conduit and they're losing time, Shepard is grateful when one of the squad offers support, but a real breakthrough comes when Captain Anderson gets in touch, asking Shepard for a discreet meeting at Flux. Anderson believes the commander's story and knows the Normandy is the only ship that can get Shepard to Ilos. He is going to unlock the Normandy's systems, allowing Shepard to steal the ship and take her to Ilos. Shepard is concerned that Anderson will be arrested and charged with treason - or worse - but Anderson sees his future as a small price to pay for stopping a galactic menace. Shepard goes to the Normandy and waits with Joker on the bridge. With Anderson's help the Normandy's systems are unlocked and they escape the Citadel, heading to Ilos.<\/p><h3>Ilos<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/1491312-ilos_overgrown_city_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1491312\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/1491312-ilos_overgrown_city_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1491312\"><img alt=\"The forested planet Ilos\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5911\/1491312-ilos_overgrown_city_2.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/1491312-ilos_overgrown_city_2.png 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/5911\/1491312-ilos_overgrown_city_2.png 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5911\/1491312-ilos_overgrown_city_2.png 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5911\/1491312-ilos_overgrown_city_2.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The forested planet Ilos\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5911\/1491312-ilos_overgrown_city_2.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/1491312-ilos_overgrown_city_2.png 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/5911\/1491312-ilos_overgrown_city_2.png 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5911\/1491312-ilos_overgrown_city_2.png 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5911\/1491312-ilos_overgrown_city_2.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The forested planet Ilos<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After Shepard's love interest spends a night in the commander's quarters, Joker announces that they're about to pass through the Mu Relay, and they soon arrive at Ilos. Shepard sees that Saren has already arrived with a fleet of geth dropships, though the Normandy's stealth system is keeping them safe for now. Navigator Pressly picks up some readings on the planet that must be Saren, but there's no landing zone nearby. Shepard suggests dropping the Mako, but they need about 100m of open terrain for a safe drop and Pressly can only find 20m. Joker insists that he can do it. The Mako is successfully dropped outside an ancient bunker, but Saren and his geth have already made it inside, shutting a heavy security door behind them.<\/p><p>Shepard looks for some way to override it. After fighting through the geth left on guard, Shepard and the squad find a security station and open the bunker doors. While in the control room, Shepard discovers an ancient Prothean recording which is heavily damaged. The Cipher allows Shepard to make out some of the words - it's another warning about the Reapers but it's just too broken up. They return to the Mako and enter the bunker. After driving past cryogenic stasis pods, all apparently shut down, Shepard sees a mysterious energy barrier. As the Mako reaches the barrier, another barrier appears behind them, trapping the squad inside. The only way out is through a door at the side of the wall. After heading down an elevator, Shepard finds an ancient Prothean VI named Vigil, who has information Shepard needs to stop the Reapers.<\/p><p>The Citadel is a trap, actually a huge mass relay linking to dark space, outside of the galaxy, where the Reapers are waiting. The keepers are presumed to be one of the earliest races to be indoctrinated by the Reapers, who set them the task of maintaining the Citadel, and activating the Citadel Relay when Sovereign signals them. Sovereign is the vanguard of the Reapers. After every Reaper attack, they leave behind one of their kind to survey and gather information on what the civilizations are up to. Once the galaxy's races have advanced enough, Sovereign will activate the Citadel Relay and usher in the next genocide. The reason the Reapers harvest the galaxy of all organic life every 50,000 years is currently unknown. According to Vigil, not even the Prothean scientists could comprehend why they do it. They may be driven by goals that organics find impossible to understand. Once the galaxy is wiped clean, the Reapers return to dark space to hibernate and save energy. In this state, they are apparently vulnerable, so they always seal the Citadel Relay behind them.<\/p><p>When the Reapers attacked 50,000 years ago, their genocide of the Protheans lasted for centuries. Ilos' personnel hid in cryogenic stasis, watched over by Vigil. However, as his energy reserves ran low, he followed 'contingency planning', and shut off the pods of non-essential personnel to conserve energy, hoping that when the time was right, he could at least open some of the pods. Vigil managed to save a dozen scientists.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5028\/1516178-the_conduit.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1516178\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5028\/1516178-the_conduit.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1516178\"><img alt=\"The Conduit\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5028\/1516178-the_conduit.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5028\/1516178-the_conduit.png 800w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5028\/1516178-the_conduit.png 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5028\/1516178-the_conduit.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Conduit\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5028\/1516178-the_conduit.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5028\/1516178-the_conduit.png 800w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5028\/1516178-the_conduit.png 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/5028\/1516178-the_conduit.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Conduit<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Conduit was a small prototype mass relay, built by the Protheans, designed to transport personnel from the research center on Ilos to the Citadel, but only in one direction. (The 'Mass Relay Statue' in the Presidium is actually a working mass relay connected to the one at Ilos). After the Prothean extinction, the few remaining Protheans on Ilos traveled to the Citadel through the Conduit, and reprogrammed it so that the keepers would not respond to the signal to activate the relay to dark space. Sovereign needed to find another way of activating the Citadel Relay, and it used Saren to find it. Saren will go through the Conduit, and gain control of the Citadel from the inside. Meanwhile, Sovereign will head to the Citadel. Once Saren transfers control of the station, Sovereign can open the Citadel Relay manually. Vigil explains that Reapers are patient. If Sovereign assaulted the Citadel alone, the combined power of the Citadel Fleet could be enough to defeat the Reaper. But with someone going in the back door to give it control, Sovereign will be able to usher in the next Reaper invasion, and complete its mission. Sovereign has been planning this for centuries, after discovering the Protheans used the keepers to try to break the cycle.<\/p><p>Vigil gives Shepard a data file that will give the commander temporary control of the Citadel to stop Sovereign. After leaving Vigil, Shepard heads through the archives, down into an old aqueduct guarded by geth, and reaches the Conduit. It is a small mass relay pointing straight up, connected to the Citadel. Saren has already gone through and left more geth on guard. Meanwhile, Sovereign begins its assault on the Citadel, escorted by a large geth fleet. The commander of the Destiny Ascension attempts to close the Citadel but the station doesn't respond - the operators at Citadel Control are all dead. Saren has begun his attack from within.<\/p><p>Back on Ilos, Shepard sees the Conduit is closing and drives the Mako directly at it. Just before the relay closes, the Conduit jumps the Mako through to the Citadel.<\/p><p>On the Presidium, now burning and heavily damaged, two geth troopers become curious about the strange blue glow around the Relay Monument. When they go to take a look, the Mako suddenly bursts through and crushes them, before rolling over and crashing against a wall. The race to stop Saren is on.<\/p><h3>Siege of the Citadel<\/h3><p>Shepard and the team manage to get out of the overturned Mako. Saren is heading toward the Council Chambers and the whole station is infested with geth. The squad tries taking the elevator to the Citadel Tower, but it stops halfway when Saren locks down the station's systems. Shepard tells the team to suit up and blows out the elevator's glass with a shot. They have to walk the rest of the way in zero gravity with their boots magnetized.<\/p><p>Meanwhile up in the Chambers, Saren - angrily shooting keepers as he goes - reaches the central console and uses it to take control of the Citadel. As Sovereign gets closer, crushing the Citadel Fleet ships in its path, Saren closes the Wards, creating an impenetrable shell around the Reaper and the geth dropships already inside. Sovereign settles on top of the Citadel Tower, preparing to open the Citadel Relay once Saren transfers full control.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4656\/958090-800px_masseffect_2008_08_13_11_16_12_75.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958090\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5575\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4656\/958090-800px_masseffect_2008_08_13_11_16_12_75.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958090\"><img alt=\"The Reapers attack the Citadel\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4656\/958090-800px_masseffect_2008_08_13_11_16_12_75.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4656\/958090-800px_masseffect_2008_08_13_11_16_12_75.png 800w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4656\/958090-800px_masseffect_2008_08_13_11_16_12_75.png 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4656\/958090-800px_masseffect_2008_08_13_11_16_12_75.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Reapers attack the Citadel\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4656\/958090-800px_masseffect_2008_08_13_11_16_12_75.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4656\/958090-800px_masseffect_2008_08_13_11_16_12_75.png 800w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4656\/958090-800px_masseffect_2008_08_13_11_16_12_75.png 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4656\/958090-800px_masseffect_2008_08_13_11_16_12_75.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Reapers attack the Citadel<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Elsewhere Shepard and the team are fighting for their lives against the geth and Saren's krogan warriors out on the Citadel's exhaust plains, trying to get to the Chambers. A geth dropship appears and starts unleashing shock troopers on them; Shepard activates the Citadel's defense turrets, and with their cover fire, takes the dropship out. Further along they run into several powerful geth turrets and have to use cover to get close enough to destroy them, or manage to sneak down a side route where krogan battlemasters are waiting. Eventually they reach a maintenance hatch that leads down into the Council Chambers, now burning and full of Saren's geth. The stairways provide some cover as the team fights towards the central console.<\/p><p>At that moment Saren appears and throws a grenade. Shepard's team are blown aside while the commander takes cover close to Saren. He urges Shepard not to be a fool - everything is lost if Shepard continues resisting Sovereign. Saren boasts that his faith faltered but Sovereign has implanted him, made him partly synthetic, perfect. This is the future of organic life. Shepard can't believe Saren allowed Sovereign to implant him. Shepard can attack Saren straight away, or try talking him down - the more Shepard talks, the more Saren is convinced, but his Reaper implants cause the turian intense pain when he begins to agree with Shepard. With enough convincing, Saren thanks the commander for freeing him before shooting himself in the head. In either case, he falls to the bottom of the Chambers, falling through the glass floor and being impaled by a large shard.<\/p><p>Using the central console, Shepard uploads Vigil's program and gains control of the Citadel. With advice from the team, Shepard opens a communication channel and gets Joker... who has the Fifth Fleet just waiting for the commander's word once the mass relays are unlocked. Shepard has to decide between sending the Fleet to defend the Destiny Ascension and save the Council, letting the Council die, or focusing on Sovereign. Once the orders are given, Joker brings the Fleet through the nearby mass relay as Shepard opens the Citadel's ward arms.<\/p><p>As the Fleet engages the ships outside - geth dropships and Sovereign itself - Shepard tells the squad to check Saren and make sure he's dead. They drop down to the bottom of the Chambers - one coldly shoots Saren in the head, while the other confirms the kill to Shepard. Suddenly Saren's body begins to twitch as his implants fire up, burning his flesh away until he is a cybernetic construct like a <a href=\"\/husk\/3015-2617\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2617\">Husk<\/a>, completely possessed by Sovereign. The shockwaves from his transformation cause the platform to collapse and Shepard falls into the bottom of the Chambers. The squad fights back against the creature, but it is fast and deadly.<\/p><p>Outside, the Normandy is leading the attack against Sovereign. The Reaper unleashes a terrible weapon that burns through several Alliance ships, but the Fleet is slowly getting the upper hand. As the squad finally destroy the cybernetic creature and it burns away to ashes, Sovereign begins to weaken under the Alliance attack and releases its grip on the station. A blast from the Normandy is the coup de grace and the Reaper is destroyed.<\/p><p>In the Chambers, Shepard looks up to see a huge piece of debris from the Reaper heading straight for the Tower. The commander yells for the squad to take cover, just as it hits. Much later, rescuers enter the Tower looking for survivors. Under a pile of rubble they discover Shepard's team... two of them, badly wounded but alive. Leading the rescuers, Captain Anderson helps them out, assures them that it's all right, and asks where Commander Shepard is. One of the squad members looks sadly across the Chambers, where the Reaper debris has crashed into the floor. It would have crushed anyone standing under it. The rescue team help the squad out of the Chambers, and Anderson looks back and sees someone moving. Commander Shepard, with an injured arm, manages to climb out from behind the debris, limps toward them, and smiles.<\/p><h3>Epilogue<\/h3><p>As a result of Shepard's decisions, there are three outcomes to the story:<\/p><p>\u2022 The Council is destroyed and the Alliance forms a new Council, with no other races involved (Renegade ending). Shepard can nominate either Ambassador Udina or Captain Anderson to chair the new Council, and they prepare to combat the Reapers with the Alliance Fleet at the forefront. If Shepard is a Renegade and claims humans should work with other races, Udina will remark that this is uncharacteristic of Shepard's previous actions, and goes on to form the human-only council anyway.<\/p><p>\u2022 The Council is destroyed and the Alliance forms a new Council, with a human chairman but the other races remaining on the Council. Shepard can nominate either Udina or Anderson to chair the new Council, and they prepare to combat the Reapers with the Alliance Fleet at the forefront. This occurs if Shepard does not save the Council, but is not a Renegade.<\/p><p>\u2022 The Alliance Fleet saves the Council (Paragon ending). In gratitude for the sacrifices of the Alliance Fleet and Shepard's help, they offer humanity the chance to become a Council race. Again, Shepard can nominate either Udina or Anderson to be the human representative, and they decide to unite all the Citadel races against the coming threat of the Reapers.<\/p><p>In all three endings, Shepard leaves the Citadel aboard the Normandy, intending to find a way to stop the Reaper invasion.<\/p><h2>Main Characters &amp; Voice Talents<\/h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Character<\/th><th>Voice Talent<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"\/commander-shepard\/3005-658\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-658\">Commander Shepard<\/a> (Male)<\/td><td><a href=\"\/mark-meer\/3040-46807\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-46807\">Mark Meer<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Commander Shepard (Female)<\/td><td><a href=\"\/jennifer-hale\/3040-4269\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-4269\">Jennifer Hale<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><a href=\"\/captain-david-anderson\/3005-3123\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3123\">Cpt.

For the mission BioWare inserted a new asteroid into the Asgard System. Shepard and his team are tasked with stopping this asteroid before it collides into Terra Nova and kills millions of innocent people. Batarians are also introduced into the universe. In this mission they are portrayed as an extremely hostile race with vengeance in their minds. They hijacked the mobile asteroid and put it in a crash coarse towards Terra Nova in order to avenge the batarian lives lost when humans colonized their home territory. <i>Bring Down the Sky<\/i> was originally released at 400 Microsoft points but had it's price permanently reduced to 80 points in spring 2010 . The mission is free to download for those with the PC version as well as came on a disc for those who bought the Platinum Hits edition.<\/p><h3>Pinnacle Station<\/h3><p><i>Pinnacle Station<\/i> is the second downloadable expansion to <i>Mass Effect<\/i>, releasing on August 25, 2009 for 400 MSP ($5). The story is far less of a focus on this expansion than the last, with a larger focus on combat. Shepard enters a station dedicated to the training of Alliance soldiers through simulations. The DLC has 4 simulation modes, Time Trial, Hunt, Survival, and Capture. 3 maps for each mode, with a total of 4 maps are included. A total of 12 simulations can be run with a special final mission unlocked after first place is reached in all previous challenges. The entirety of the DLC runs 2 to 3 hours. Many questioned why BioWare would release a second DLC a year and a half after the last DLC and two years after the game released.<\/p><h3>Cancelled DLC<\/h3><p>At least one more DLC was planned for <em>Mass Effect. <\/em>One of the game's composers,<em> Sam Hullick, <\/em>uploaded a <a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/mDDZhhboop8\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">music track<\/a> for an unreleased DLC. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LesPaulDuJour\/status\/340657401965449216\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">On Twitter<\/a>, a BioWare employee (Ryan Warden) confirmed that they had started working on a DLC taking place on Caleston, but it didn't get very far. Caleston was the name of the planet featured in the X06 walk through for the game. It is unknown what the DLC would have contained or why it was cancelled, though a possibility is due to a change in publisher.<\/p><h2>Soundtrack<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/84290\/1344269-154528051f3dnqxwml._ss500_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1344269\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/84290\/1344269-154528051f3dnqxwml._ss500_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1344269\"><img alt=\"Cover Art\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/84290\/1344269-154528051f3dnqxwml._ss500_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/84290\/1344269-154528051f3dnqxwml._ss500_.jpg 500w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cover Art\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/84290\/1344269-154528051f3dnqxwml._ss500_.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/84290\/1344269-154528051f3dnqxwml._ss500_.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Cover Art<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The <i>Mass Effect<\/i> <a href=\"\/original-soundtrack\/3015-189\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-189\">soundtrack<\/a> was composed by <a href=\"\/jack-wall\/3040-38094\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-38094\">Jack Wall<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sam-hulick\/3040-97797\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-97797\">Sam Hulick<\/a>.

It's initial unveiling at the X05 event showed a bald Shepard wearing white armor rather than the black N7 armor used in later promotions. Shepard's default appearance would change again in the following year. At Microsoft's E3 2006 press conference the game was briefly shown in a montage showing First Party games. After E3, a video walkthrough by project lead Casey Hudson was released online and on the Xbox Live Marketplace. The video showed off the dialogue wheel via a conversation at the club <em>Flux <\/em>on the <em>Citadel. <\/em>This conversation, as well as the characters Shepard talks to, are not in the final game. Combat also went through an overhaul. In the video demonstration, the player could switch between characters to directly control them, just like in BioWare's original Xbox RPG <a href=\"\/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic\/3030-18741\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18741\">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic<\/a>.<\/p><p> <\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/21156\/2490297-5761062321-maxre.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2490297\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/21156\/2490297-5761062321-maxre.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2490297\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/21156\/2490297-5761062321-maxre.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/21156\/2490297-5761062321-maxre.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/2\/21156\/2490297-5761062321-maxre.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/21156\/2490297-5761062321-maxre.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/21156\/2490297-5761062321-maxre.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/21156\/2490297-5761062321-maxre.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/2\/21156\/2490297-5761062321-maxre.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/2\/21156\/2490297-5761062321-maxre.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Months later, at the X06 another video walkthrough was released. One of the main features in this walkthrough was Shepard's ability to interrupt who ever He was speaking to (Garrus in this case.) Interruptions were dropped from the original game, but brought back in the sequels, albeit in a slightly different way. The Planet shown in the X06 demo exists in the game, but is known as <em>Therum<\/em> rather than <em>Caleston. <\/em><\/p><p> <\/p><p>As the game approached it's November 2007 launch date it started to look more like we know it now. Several small changes were made. Perhaps most notably was the inclusion of the Weapon\/Power Wheel, which would later become a trade mark of the series. Before the wheels were added, the player had to use the D pad on the Xbox 360 controller to select a power to use. Different powers, weapons, and squad commands could be chosen by holding down one the \"X\" \"Y\" or \"B\" button on the controller. Another feature that was removed was an armor crafting bench in the hangar of the Normandy. The crafting bench is briefly shown in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/mass-effect\/videos\/mass-effect-stage-demo-1-6174539\/\" data-ref-id=\"false\">stage demo with GameSpot<\/a>. It is unknown how it would have worked or why it was removed.<\/p>",

Along the way, Shepard must assemble an elite inter-specie team from the dark, seedy underbelly of the galaxy, and prepare for what appears to be a suicide mission.<\/p><p>The gameplay in Mass Effect 2 is significantly redesigned compared to the first game, including the ability to interrupt conversations via <a href=\"\/moral-decisions\/3015-93\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-93\">renegade and paragon actions<\/a>, a completely revamped <a href=\"..\/..\/inventory\/92-513\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">inventory<\/a> system, automatic <a href=\"..\/..\/regenerating-health\/92-83\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">health regeneration<\/a> (as opposed to requiring the use of medigel), and an improved combat system that includes facilitating <a href=\"\/cover-system\/3015-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-55\">cover<\/a>, as well as altered class development options.<\/p><p>As the game is a direct continuation of the first one, it supports the ability to <a href=\"\/character-import\/3015-970\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-970\">import completed savegames<\/a> from the first game, transferring Shepard's appearance, background, and morality score while integrating most plot decisions (to maintain continuation) and giving bonuses to both experience points and credits. An interactive digital comic, titled <em>Mass Effect: Genesis<\/em>, was released a year later as paid DLC, detailing the game's backstory while allowing players to make key plot decisions (which is then applied to the player's created character).<\/p><p>The game was later ported to the <a href=\"\/playstation-3\/3045-35\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3<\/a> on January 18, 2011, enhancing the graphics engine while including numerous DLC for free. Because there was no way to play the original Mass Effect for the PlayStation 3 at the time, the <em>Mass Effect: Genesis<\/em> comic was also included for free.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><h3>Combat mechanics<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1221371\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/30\/1221371-sfdeclazarus3.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/30\/1221371-sfdeclazarus3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1221371\"><img alt=\"Battling a heavy mech\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/30\/1221371-sfdeclazarus3.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/30\/1221371-sfdeclazarus3.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/30\/1221371-sfdeclazarus3.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/30\/1221371-sfdeclazarus3.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/30\/1221371-sfdeclazarus3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Battling a heavy mech<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Mass Effect 2 has radical gameplay changes since the first installment; however, overall the basis of the game remains the same. Commander Shepard must acquire a team, can use this team in missions, but only two squadmates at a time, and levels up as the game progresses. The game remains a third person, cover based shooter. The most radical gameplay changes are the re-assortment of classes, weapons skills and the combat experience. Classes have been refined and there abilities have been changed to add more impact, meanwhile weapons have been assorted into groups. The radial menu to use skills remains intact, but unlike the first game, only one skill can be used at a time. In addition, a global cooldown for powers is employed rather than the individual cooldowns used in the previous game.<\/p><h3>Inventory<\/h3><p>The inventory has also been radically redefined as an inventory \"menu\" is almost non-existent and \"loot\" has been limited to money and weapons upgrades. The player chooses his load-out before a mission, and can change his armor at an armory in his\/her cabin. The overall <a href=\"..\/..\/heads-up-display\/92-180\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HUD<\/a> (Heads-Up Display) has also been radically changed. Health is regenerative, and enemies health\/armor\/shields are all shown in bars when a player's reticule hovers over them. Combat has been changed by opting out of unlimited ammo and adding ammo through the use of \"heat sinks.\" These are standard for all of Shepard's weapons and are used throughout the galaxy being dropped by almost any dead enemy. Heavy weapons have been added as an extra weapon class to give Commander Shepard a strategic advantage when a situation goes out of control. These use Power Cells as their ammunition system, and like the heat sinks are universal in all heavy weapons. The heavy weapons range from the Arc Projector, which fires out lightning, to the M-920 Cain which causes a miniature nuclear explosion.<\/p><p>The overall tone of the game is also darker and grittier. While the first game had Shepard touring the Citadel and exploring the Mass Effect universe the second game is more linear. The story has multiple uses of crime gangs, mercenary groups, and warlords and takes the player through the darker part of the galaxy. This includes slums in Omega, and war-torn worlds such as the krogan homeworld of <a href=\"..\/..\/tuchanka\/95-2702\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tuchanka<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Dialogue Trees\/ Interrupt Feature<\/h3><p>In terms of dialogue, a new interrupt feature have been added where the player is given the option to interrupt a conversation by performing either a Renegade or Paragon action. Also, having the option for paragon\/renegade dialogue choices is no longer managed by a skill, but instead by the overall points a player has accumulated over the course of the game, which is defined by his\/her actions.<\/p><h3>Hammerhead (Mako's replacement)<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1465879\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22435\/1465879-hammer.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2572463768116\" data-width=\"552\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 552px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22435\/1465879-hammer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1465879\"><img alt=\"The DLC Hammerhead vehicle, hoped to improve upon the Mako\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px\" data-width=\"509\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22435\/1465879-hammer.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22435\/1465879-hammer.jpg 552w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22435\/1465879-hammer.jpg 509w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The DLC Hammerhead vehicle, hoped to improve upon the Mako\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22435\/1465879-hammer.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/2\/22435\/1465879-hammer.jpg 552w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/2\/22435\/1465879-hammer.jpg 509w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px\" data-width=\"509\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The DLC Hammerhead vehicle, hoped to improve upon the Mako<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The <a href=\"..\/..\/m35-mako\/93-250\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mako<\/a> has not made a return, and instead planetary scanning has taken its place. Planetary Scanning opts out of landing on planets that look, for the most part, the same and instead the player takes control of the Normandy and scans a planet for minerals which can be used for upgrades. Instead of landing on planets to do sidequests, Shepard can partake in \"N7 Missions\" which offer more depth and a more varied amount of scenery. The <a href=\"..\/..\/m-44-hammerhead\/93-4360\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hammerhead<\/a> was added later through free DLC which tries to refine the Mako experience.<\/p><h3>Save Import<\/h3><p>Mass Effect 2 allows the player to use a save-import system, wherein a player can import their character from Mass Effect. This imports their character's look, and choices made in the first game which will have impact in the second game. This will effect whether certain characters appear or not, whether some quests are available, and reactions from people around the player to his\/her previous actions. This tracking of choices will continue onwards to Mass Effect 3.<\/p><h2>Classes (Shepard)<\/h2><p>New players to the game can choose from six different classes for Commander Shepard, each focusing on a different set of abilities for use in combat situations. These abilities are split into three categories:<\/p><ul><li><p><b>Combat<\/b> - Focused on weapon efficiency and physical fitness. Combat users primarily have the ability to use different ammo types for their weapons.<\/p><\/li><li><p><b>Biotic<\/b> - Focused on special abilities using the character's <a href=\"..\/..\/biotics\/92-4299\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">bio-amp implants<\/a>. Biotic users primarily have the ability to manipulate dark energy fields, which can cause direct damage and disarray to enemies.<\/p><\/li><li><p><b>Tech<\/b> - Focused on special abilities using the character's omni-tool. Tech users primarily have the ability to throw elemental attacks at enemies.<\/p><\/li><\/ul><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>Soldier<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2165221\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/87790\/2165221-class_soldier.png\" data-ratio=\"1.3487903225806\" data-width=\"496\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 496px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/87790\/2165221-class_soldier.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2165221\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" data-width=\"474\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/2165221-class_soldier.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/87790\/2165221-class_soldier.png 496w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/2165221-class_soldier.png 474w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/2165221-class_soldier.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/87790\/2165221-class_soldier.png 496w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/2165221-class_soldier.png 474w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" data-width=\"474\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Pure combat specialists who, through intense weapons training, can focus directly on their targets for lethal accuracy.

This included adding completely new weapons, such as the Heavy Weapons subset. BioWare has also released DLC packs that include more weapons. The weapons can be classified into six categories and 3-4 weapons within each subset excluding the Heavy Weapons subset which include:<\/p><h3>Assault Rifles<\/h3><ul><li><b><a href=\"..\/..\/m-8-avenger\/93-3707\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-8 Avenger<\/a>:<\/b> A common, versatile, military-grade assault rifle. Accurate when fired in short bursts, and deadly when fired on full auto. The Avenger is effective at penetrating shields, armor, and biotic barriers. The modular design and inexpensive components of the Avenger make it a favorite of military groups and mercenaries alike. The avenger has a reputation for being tough, reliable, easy to use, and easy to upgrade. Manufactured by the Elkoss Combine.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b><a href=\"..\/..\/m-15-vindicator\/93-3694\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-15 Vindicator<\/a>:<\/b> A battle rifle favored by assassins and elite mercenaries that fires in highly accurate five-round bursts, and effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers, Upgrades the Avenger Assault Rifle. Manufactured by Elanus Risk Control Services for the Blue Suns mercenary group, the Vindicator is quickly gaining popularity in the Terminus Systems.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b><a href=\"..\/..\/m-76-revenant\/93-3706\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-76 Revenant<\/a>:<\/b> Unleashes a storm of deadly high-velocity slugs. Less accurate than an assault rifle, but has a high ammo capacity and deals much more damage. Effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Vindicator Battle Rifle. This custom-made machine gun features technology not widely available. Protected against replication by sophisticated Fabrication Rights Management technology, only the richest and most powerful warlords can afford this weapon.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>M-96 Mattock Heavy Rifle<\/b><b>:<\/b> Bringing a flash from the past, the Mattock is an old rifle modified to work with thermal clips. The idea of bringing the gun on the ship was of joint origin coming up from Miranda Lawson, and the ship's AI, EDI. Firing at medium range and being semi automatic, the Mattock is effective against armor, shields, and barriers. The Mattock is a semi-automatic hybrid weapon with an assault rifle's low heat production and a sniper rifle's punch. Though it does not have a sniper rifle's precision scope, marksmen favor its increased power over that of an assault rifle to bring down hardened targets, its lack of a fully automatic setting is advertised as a feature rather than a shortcoming since it curbs a soldier's tendency to spray inaccurate fire under stress. (Firepower Weapons Pack)<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Geth Pulse Rifle:<\/b> A Geth assault rifle that is effective against shields and biotic barriers. They are rarely recovered from the battlefield, and are generally considered difficult to maintain or repair and have yet to be replicated by any organic species. Though it is comparable to the M-15 Vindicator in its effectiveness, there are two major anomalies that differentiate it from other assault rifles. First, it has a variable rate of fire due its mass effect field generation technology following a sine curve. Second, its slugs are lighter than standard M-8 Avenger slugs, but they are encased in a phasic envelope. It should be noted that this weapon is only available to the player on a Hardcore or Insanity-level play-through. It can be found on Haestrom.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Shotguns<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"..\/..\/m-22-eviscerator\/93-3695\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>M-22<\/b><\/a> <b><a href=\"..\/..\/m-22-eviscerator\/93-3695\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eviscerator Shotgun<\/a>:<\/b> A non-military civilian designed shotgun. The unique ammunition generator utilized by the Eviscerator makes it a powerful anti-armor weapon with a longer range than standard shotguns. The illegal nature of the design prevents this weapon from be distributed to military entities. This lethal close range weapon is available as part of a download including the Cerberus Assault Armor and can be acquired through the Cerberus Network.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b><a href=\"..\/..\/m-23-katana\/93-3696\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-23 Katana<\/a>:<\/b> Common military shotgun. Deadly at short range, but ineffective at long range. Very effective against shields and biotic barriers, but weak against armor. Manufactured by Ariake Technologies, the Katana is a common mercenary weapon and is also popular on colonies with varren infestations.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b><a href=\"..\/..\/m-27-scimitar\/93-3697\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-27 Scimitar<\/a>:<\/b> An elite military shotgun capable of rapid fire, this weapon is deadly at short range, but ineffective at long range. Effective against shields and biotic barriers, but weak against armor. Upgrades the Katana Shotgun. Manufactured by Ariake Technologies, the Scimitar features twin mass effect generators, giving it a more rapid rate of fire than a traditional shotgun. This weapon was created for the Eclipse mercenary band but is rapidly becoming popular with Blood Pack mercenaries, as well.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b><a href=\"..\/..\/m-300-claymore\/93-3700\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-300 Claymore<\/a>:<\/b> Very rare Krogan shotgun. Deals high damage at short range; less effective at long range. Effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Scimitar Assault Shotgun. The Claymores is of human design but is only used by Krogan as the kickback from a single shot is enough to break a human's arm. Its large slugs are effective against armored targets. Protected by sophisticated Fabrication Rights Management technology, this weapon is nearly impossible to reproduce and its prohibitively expensive.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Geth Plasma Shotgun:<\/b> Coming out of one of Cerberus cell's researching the Geth. The Geth Plasma Shotgun is deadly weapon. This three-barreled Geth weapon fires miniature but potent cluster rounds of superconducting projectiles and has a longer range than standard shotguns. A two stage trigger system allows for either quick-fire capacitors or a charge-and-release attack to electrify the projectiles as they exit the weapon. As the rounds hit the target, they fragment and electricity arcs between the pieces, flash-converting the air to conductive plasma. The resulting impact, heat, and electrical charge overloads shields and barriers and causes massive trauma to unarmored targets.

Incredibly accurate at long range, but rate of fire is slow. Effective against armor, but weaker against shields and biotic barriers. Manufactured by Devlon Industries, the Mantis is primarily used by police and planetary militia groups. The prevalence of kinetic barriers has made this weapon less popular with the military, but it is used more frequently in the Terminus system where defenses are less common.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b><a href=\"..\/..\/m-97-viper\/93-3709\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-97 Viper<\/a>:<\/b> Rapid-fire military sniper rifle. Incredibly accurate and deadly at long range, these weapons are popular amongst infiltrators and assassins. Very effective against armor; somewhat effective against shields and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Mantis Sniper Rifle. Rosenkov Materials developed this deadly weapon in response to the rising prevalence of kinetic barriers. While kinetic barriers still offer some protection from this weapon, it's sheer power and rapid rate of fire make it capable of quickly killing almost any target, regardless of its defenses.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b><a href=\"..\/..\/m-98-widow\/93-3710\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-98 Widow<\/a>:<\/b> Accurate and deadly anti-material rifle. Effective against armor, shields, and biotic barriers. Upgrades the Viper Sniper Rifle. Weighing in at 39 kilograms, the Widow Anti-Material Rifle is primarily used by sniper teams in assault missions against armored vehicles or Krogan. While kinetic barriers offer effective protection on vehicles, the kind generated by conventional military field generators are far too weak against the Widow. The Widow was never designed to be carried and fired by a human. Although this modified model can be carried, no ordinary human could fire it without shattering an arm.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>M-29 Incisor:<\/b> The Incisor is one of a new wave of military and police sniper rifles designed to overload active defenses such as shields. Firing three shots with each pull of the trigger, the Incisor's burst is so fast that all three rounds will be in the target by the time the barrel has moved a millimeter, increasing its stopping power without sacrificing accuracy. As an added benefit, the noise of the burst is comparable to a single rifle shot in duration, making it no easier to locate the sniper by sound.

A highly accurate and lethal sidearm. Effective against armor; weak against shields and biotic barriers. The M5 Phalanx is the product of the Alliance's Offensive Handgun Project that developed a close in weapon to be used on armored or shielded targets with no loss of stopping power in comparison to the soldier's assault rifle. The Phalanx enjoys a ballistics advantage even over most \"hand cannons\" and features an integral laser sight which is highly visible even in bright lighting conditions. Civilian variants are often purchased by colonists on planets that have particularly dangerous game animals.

Very effective against shields and biotic barriers, inaccurate at long rage. Weak against armor. Upgrades the Shuriken Machine Pistol. The commonality of kinetic barriers has led to increased demand for rapid-fire weapons like the Tempest. Produced by Elanus Risk Control Services for the Eclipse mercenary band, the Tempest is an expensive but deadly addition to anyone's personal arsenal.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b><a href=\"..\/..\/m-12-locust\/93-3692\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-12 Locust<\/a>:<\/b> The Kassa Fabrications Model 12 Locust is a compact submachine gun developed for the Alliance but now favored by gang enforcers and hitmen.

The next step beyond the Husks, Scions, are beings that are the fusion of 3 transformed human beings that are grafted biologically to a weapon.<\/p><p><b>Mercenaries:<\/b><\/p><p>Three major mercenary groups are encountered throughout Mass Effect 2:<\/p><ol><li><b>The Blue Suns<\/b>, the largest mercenary group consisting of mostly of Turians, Humans, and Batarians started by <a href=\"..\/..\/zaeed-messani\/94-13667\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zaeed Massani<\/a> and Vido Santiago.<\/li><li><b>The Eclipse<\/b> are another mercenary group that operate in tight groups and often employ Asari, Salarians, and a few Humans.<\/li><li><b>The Blood Pack<\/b> is a group consisting of Vorcha and Krogan that have been banned from Citadel space.<\/li><\/ol><p><b>Security Mechs:<\/b><\/p><p>These mechs include LOKI, YMIR, and FENRIS mechs.

Unexpectedly, the Normandy comes under attack by an unknown force in a large spaceship. Shepard orders an evacuation of the ship as they are no match for this unknown attacker but cannot escape himself, because he has to rescue Joker who refuses to abandon ship. Shepard is able to get Joker safely to an escape pod, before he is thrown into space as the Normandy is destroyed by the unknown ship. Shepard floats in space briefly, before suit damage causes his suit to depressurize. This is the apparent end for Commander Shepard, as he falls, immobile, towards the surface of a planet.<\/p><p>Shepard's body is then picked up by an extremist group called <a href=\"..\/..\/cerberus\/92-3233\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cerberus<\/a>, an organization created to protect and advance humanity's interests in the galaxy no matter the cost. This ideal often manifests itself with ruthless behavior which causes the group to be considered more akin to a terrorist group than as a legitimate entity, especially from within the human Alliance which regards them as a severe embarrassment to their own efforts at peaceful co-existence.<\/p><p>Cerberus begins work on rebuilding Shepard's body as part of an effort codenamed \"The Lazarus Project\". After two years of work, Shepard is rebuilt, although he is awakened before he can be fully tested physically and psychologically. When he awakes, Shepard finds himself in a lab woken up by <a href=\"..\/..\/miranda-lawson\/94-13205\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miranda Lawson<\/a> who is urging him to get up and move since the station where Project Lazarus was being conducted was attacked by mechs. Shepard is able to fight his way through the station and finds Jacob, a Cerberus operative who was serving as security chief for the station. He and Shepard make their way through the station together (much to the dismay of Shepard, still dazed and confused, and angry that he has found himself inadvertently working for Cerberus) and find Wilson, a doctor who had helped in recreating and reviving Shepard. Wilson was injured and with Shepard's help is healed enough to join them. Wilson informs them that the mechs on the station have been overridden by someone and he had tried to disarm them but was unsuccessful. This makes Jacob suspicious because Wilson should not have access to mechs since he works in medical. Wilson deflects his suspicion by blaming Miranda who he claims is conveniently missing while they are in harm's way. Jacob wants to go find Miranda but Wilson tells them to forget her and that they should just make their way to escape shuttle since there is no way she survived. They decide to go to escape but right as they open the door to the shuttle bay they find Miranda waiting there. To everyone's surprise she shoots Wilson and states that he was a traitor and that he had reprogrammed the security mechs to attack everyone. They then escape the station and Miranda takes Shepard to meet her boss, the Illusive Man.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1261658\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/30036\/1261658-mass_effect_normandy_sr2.png\" data-ratio=\"0.46875\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:46.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/30036\/1261658-mass_effect_normandy_sr2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1261658\"><img alt=\"The New Normandy\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/30036\/1261658-mass_effect_normandy_sr2.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/30036\/1261658-mass_effect_normandy_sr2.png 800w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/30036\/1261658-mass_effect_normandy_sr2.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The New Normandy\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/30036\/1261658-mass_effect_normandy_sr2.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/3\/30036\/1261658-mass_effect_normandy_sr2.png 800w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/3\/30036\/1261658-mass_effect_normandy_sr2.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The New Normandy<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Following his resurrection, Shepard meets with the leader of Cerberus, the mysteriously named <a href=\"..\/..\/the-illusive-man\/94-10097\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Illusive Man<\/a>.

Using Dossiers given by the Illusive Man on \"the toughest, the brightest, the deadliest allies we can find\", Shepard begins assembling an elite team after discovering proof at the colony of Freedom's Progress revealing the involvement of a mysterious race known only as the <a href=\"..\/..\/the-collectors\/92-4352\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Collectors<\/a>, who may or may not have an alliance with the Reapers.<\/p><p>After gathering the squad and going on various Collector-based tasks assigned by the Illusive Man such as going on the Collector ship for data or a derelict Reaper for an IFF Shepard will finally go through the <a href=\"..\/..\/omega-4-relay\/93-3365\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Omega-4 Relay<\/a> where player-made decisions made in the game will affect the outcome of this final mission.

After more fighting Shepard and two other crew-mates will encounter the reason the Collectors have been abducting tens of thousands of people. A giant humanoid Reaper stares at them in the face still in a state of being built. After an epic battle against this humanoid Reaper the <a href=\"..\/..\/collector-base\/93-3367\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Collector Base<\/a> can either be destroyed or kept intact for technology; however, both outcomes lead to the death of all the collectors on board.

Optionally, in the Options menu, players can toggle Shepard's headpiece so it does not show up during dialogue. Some pieces can be found throughout missions, but all can be found within Citadel stores.<\/p><ul><li><b>N7 Helmet<\/b> - Initially available.

Combat users primarily have the ability to use different ammo types for their weapons.<\/p><\/li><li><p><b>Biotic<\/b> - Focused on special abilities using the character's <a href=\"\/biotics\/3015-4299\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4299\">bio-amp implants<\/a>. Biotic users primarily have the ability to manipulate dark energy fields, which can cause direct damage and disarray to enemies.<\/p><\/li><li><p><b>Tech<\/b> - Focused on special abilities using the character's omni-tool. Tech users primarily have the ability to throw elemental attacks at enemies.<\/p><\/li><\/ul><p>Unlike the previous games in the franchise, class proficiencies do not restrict Shepard to any kind of weapon or armor. However, different classes have different weight capacity bonuses (high-Combat classes can carry heavier weapons with less burden on the cooldown timers of their active powers).<\/p><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>Soldier<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/87790\/2165221-class_soldier.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2165221\" data-ratio=\"1.3487903225806\" data-width=\"496\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 496px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/87790\/2165221-class_soldier.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2165221\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/2165221-class_soldier.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/87790\/2165221-class_soldier.png 496w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/87790\/2165221-class_soldier.png 474w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" data-width=\"474\"><\/a><\/figure><p>Pure combat specialists who, through intense weapons training, can focus directly on their targets for lethal accuracy.

Along the way, they must perform certain objectives, such as eliminating key enemy personnel and hacking enemy equipment.<\/p><p>Players earn currency which allows them to buy special \"Reinforcement Packs\", containing special cards that unlock character slots, armor customization options, equipment, item slots, weapons, and weapon modifications. By leveling up their character classes, as well as obtaining high-level equipment, squads have a better chance of finishing high-difficulty missions.<\/p><p>All versions require an <a href=\"\/origin\/3015-7040\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7040\">Origin<\/a> account to access this mode. Prior to May 30, 2013, the 360 and PS3 versions of the mode required the activation of an <a href=\"\/new-purchase-incentives\/3015-5244\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5244\">\"online pass\"<\/a> DLC (included in new copies of the game or sold for $10 on official storefronts).<\/p><h3>Gameplay<\/h3><p>The goal in each multiplayer mission is to team up with up to three allies and exterminate ten <a href=\"\/horde\/3015-3021\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\">waves<\/a> of enemies (which gradually get more difficult with the addition of tougher enemies) while achieving special objectives. These objectives activate every third, sixth, and tenth wave and consist of one of the following (at random):<\/p><ul><li><p>Within five minutes, players must hack four randomly-placed beacons in a particular order. They do this by directly interacting with each device (a slow process that makes the hacker defenseless) until the hacker's progress meter fills up completely. If the hack process is stopped abruptly, the progress meter is reset. While multiple players can hack the same device at the same time, it does not speed up the process in any way. (Though it can be used to counter <a href=\"\/griefing\/3015-87\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-87\">griefing<\/a>, as people can pretend to hack the device only to stop at the last second)<\/p><\/li><li><p>Within five minutes, players must upload data from a randomly-placed terminal by activating it and then standing near it for a certain amount of time. When more players stand near the terminal, the upload process becomes faster.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Within a short amount of time, players must eliminate five specific enemies in a particular order. Successfully eliminating the enemy adds time to the countdown timer.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Within a short amount of time, players must retrieve two high priority packages and transport them to a designated extraction zone. Players carrying the packages cannot sprint, evade, or use certain powers. Added in the Rebellion Pack DLC.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Within a short amount of time, players must activate and escort a Combat Drone to a designated extraction zone. When more players stand near the drone, its speed increases. The drone occasionally replenishes nearby player shields and attacks nearby enemies with missiles or electric shocks. Added in the Earth DLC.<\/p><\/li><\/ul><p>If the team fails the objective by letting the countdown timer hit zero, the mission fails and the game is over immediately. Succeeding each objective grants both bonus experience and Credits. After the tenth wave, the team have two minutes to retreat to the evacuation zone and defend their position against never-ending swarms of enemies.<\/p><h3>Classes<\/h3><p>Players can create one customizable character for each character slot (based on the classes below). From the start, players are limited to the two human slots for all classes, each with minimal armor customization. Players can unlock new character slots (per race per class) and cosmetic customization options (for each character slot) by unlocking special character cards inside Reinforcement Packs (determined by rarity). Unlocking character cards also grant bonus experience points for the entire class.<\/p><p>Along with a unique assortment of active powers, each race also has their own amount of base health and base shield strength, evasion maneuver (with some races unable to evade at all), class restrictions, and melee attacks. Some races have their own unique ability (such as Rage for krogans, which gives them into a temporary buff after consecutive melee kills).<\/p><h4>Adept<\/h4><ul><li><b><a href=\"\/human\/3015-810\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-810\">Human<\/a> Adept<\/b> (Common) - Active Powers: Singularity, Warp, Shockwave.<\/li><li><b><a href=\"\/drell\/3015-4350\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4350\">Drell<\/a><b> Adept<\/b><\/b> (Uncommon) - Active Powers: Reave, Pull, Cluster Grenade.<\/li><li><b><a href=\"\/asari\/3015-1582\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1582\">Asari<\/a><b> Adept<\/b><\/b> (Rare) - Active Powers: Statis, Warp, Throw.<\/li><li><b>Asari Justicar<\/b> (Rare) - Added in the Resurgence Pack DLC.

After reaching level 20 with a single class, players can promote that class, resetting the level back down to 1 while granting bonuses for the Galaxy At War system and the N7 ranking. (Unlocked races and armor customization options are still kept)<\/p><h3>Equipment<\/h3><p>In multiplayer mode, equipment are single-use items found inside most Reinforcement Packs that are split into three categories:<\/p><ul><li><p><b>Bonuses<\/b> - Special single-use armor and weapon modifications that can be assigned to the individual player prior to starting the match. Players can assign one bonus at a time in each category: Ammo (which grants one of the five ammo type powers to all of the player's weapons), Weapon (which grants a damage bonus for one weapon type), and Armor (which grants a bonus to either shield, movement speed, power damage, or power recharge speed). Each bonus comes in three levels of strength (increasing their effectiveness), with level 1 bonuses appearing in Common-oriented booster packs and level 3 bonuses appearing in Rare-oriented booster packs. Once the player downloads the Resurgence Pack DLC, he\/she can find a new Weapon Bonus (which grants a damage bonus for melee attacks) and new Armor Bonuses (which grants a bonus to either power duration, shield recharge speed, weapon stability, or headshot damage).<\/p><\/li><li><p><b>Supplies<\/b> - Special in-game inventory items that can be activated in-game to quell desperate situations. Consists of the Cobra Missile Launcher (in which the player switches to a powerful one-shot missile launcher that can destroy all enemies in a large radius), Thermal Clip Pack (automatically refilling the player's thermal clips and grenade supply), Ops Survival Pack (automatically refilling the player's health and shields), and Medi-Gel (automatically reviving the player if he\/she is incapacitated). Players can carry up to two (more if he\/she finds a Supply Upgrade) of each supply.<\/p><\/li><li><p><b>Supply Upgrades<\/b> - Rare cards that automatically adds one to the capacity of a random supply, allowing the player to use more of that supply in one match.<\/p><\/li><\/ul><p>In addition, players can rarely find a \"Reset Powers\" card which they can use to reset the power distribution of one character slot (retaining all of the class's experience points). Players can carry a maximum of three \"Reset Powers\" options at one time.<\/p><h3>Reinforcement Packs<\/h3><p>Players earn currency (known as Credits) in-game (by successfully completing special objectives) which allows them to buy special Reinforcement Packs, containing special cards that unlock character slots, equipment, item slots, weapons, and weapon modifications. For most packs, players can also <a href=\"\/microtransaction\/3015-199\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-199\">use real currency instead<\/a>.<\/p><p>Earning character cards for character slots players have already unlocked instead grants additional armor customization options (as well as additional experience points).

For every weekend, players participates in challenges (such as dealing a certain amount of damage with a weapon) to earn a bonus \"Commendation Pack\" (earning them a special N7 weapon).<\/p><p>Prior to October 21, 2012, these events had a community requirement (such as killing one million of a certain enemy, overall) that must be fulfilled to earn a \"Victory Pack\". Three of these events resulted in failure, causing a penalty in their following weekend event (such as Operation BROADSIDE, which extended the extraction time by 30 seconds).<\/p><h2>Cross-Promotions<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123979\" data-ratio=\"1.279296875\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123979\"><img alt=\"Crossover promotional image with Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8960\/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/8960\/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg 750w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8960\/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg 500w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Crossover promotional image with Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8960\/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8960\/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/8960\/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg 750w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8960\/2123979-me3kar_crossover.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" data-width=\"500\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Crossover promotional image with Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>To promote both Mass Effect 3 and <a href=\"..\/..\/kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning\/61-30330\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning<\/a>, another action RPG published by <a href=\"..\/..\/electronic-arts\/65-1\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Electronic Arts<\/a>, both games have exclusive content that can be unlocked by playing the demo of the other game:<\/p><ul><li><b>Reckoner Knight Armor<\/b> - Special non-customizable armor (which boosts helath, shields, weapon damage, and melee damage) for Shepard in Mass Effect 3 that can be unlocked by linking to an <a href=\"\/origin\/3015-7040\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7040\">Origin<\/a> account that has played the Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning demo.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Chakram Launcher -<\/strong> A chargeable semi-automatic rifle for Mass Effect 3 (single-player campaign only) that can be unlocked by linking to an Origin account that has watched the end video, shown at the end of the Kingdom of Amalur: Reckoning demo, in its entirety.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><strong>Omniblade Daggers -<\/strong> Daggers resembling the omni-tool blades for Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning that can be unlocked by linking to an Origin account that has played the Mass Effect 3 demo.<\/li><\/ul><p>To promote both Mass Effect 3 and <a href=\"\/battlefield-3\/3030-27006\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27006\">Battlefield 3<\/a>, a modern military first-person shooter published by Electronic Arts, both games have exclusive content cross-promoting each-other:<\/p><ul><li><b>Battlefield 3 Soldier<\/b> - A multiplayer character slot for the Soldier class featuring a non-customizable armor based on the \"Soldier of Fire\" promotional image for Battlefield 3 that can be unlocked in Mass Effect 3 by linking to an Origin account that is tied to a Battlefield 3 Online Pass.

The <a href=\"..\/..\/asari\/92-1582\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asari<\/a> councilor informs Shepard that information regarding the Catalyst is contained in a <a href=\"..\/..\/protheans\/92-1751\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Prothean<\/a> artifact located on Thessia. The last mission to gain council aid involves the Asari homeworld of Thessia. While Shepard does not manage to help save Thessia from Reaper attacks, he finds that the Crucible needs a Catalyst in order to successfully destroy the Reapers. Just before acquiring the information, Kai Leng and Cerberus attack and steal the information from Shepard. Admiral Hackett and Shepard launch an attack on the Cerberus and the Illusive Man's headquarters, and find that the Catalyst was in front of them all along - The Citadel.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/2141067-at02_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2141067\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/2141067-at02_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2141067\"><img alt=\"Cerberus is at it again.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5911\/2141067-at02_001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/2141067-at02_001.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/5911\/2141067-at02_001.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5911\/2141067-at02_001.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cerberus is at it again.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5911\/2141067-at02_001.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/5911\/2141067-at02_001.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/5911\/2141067-at02_001.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/5911\/2141067-at02_001.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Cerberus is at it again.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Unforunately, the Reapers found out that knowledge of the Catalyst was discovered, and the Citadel was closed and moved beside Earth in order to prevent the Crucible from being used. It's at this point that Shepard combines all united forces and coordinates an attack to retake the Citadel and combine it with the Crucible to destroy the Reapers. Due to the closure of the Citadel, the allied forces find that they must reopen it by using a beam being ejected to earth from the Citadel.<\/p><p>At this point, Shepard and Hammer team make a final assault toward the beam, but the majority of the squad is wiped out when Harbinger intervenes and Shepard is hit by a blast. Staggering, Shepard manages to reach the beam, and finds that Anderson had done so as well. When they find a control panel, they are interrupted by the Illusive Man who's still bent on finding ways to control the Reapers and stop Shepard from destroying them. Eventually, the Illusive Man is defeated, but Anderson dies and Shepard loses consciousness just before being informed that the Crucible did not fire.<\/p><p>Shepard awakens and is greeted by an artificial intelligence who refers to himself as the Catalyst. The Catalyst informs Shepard that he is the entity controlling the Reapers, and that their purpose is to preserve organic life by exterminating the most advanced forms of life at the end of every cycle. He explains that it is necessary as organic life is always opposed by the synthetic life that they create and are doomed to be destroyed by their own creations.<\/p><p>The Catalyst also explains that life is not wasted, but merely harvested and used to create more reapers and less capable, primitive organic lifeforms are spared for the start of the new cycle. The Catalyst then admits that since Shepard proved that the cycle could not continue as it has by building the Crucible, a new plan has to be made. He offers Shepard one of three choices: Destroy the Reapers as well as all Synthetic life, Control the Reapers, or create a Synergy between organics and synthetics. The synergy would create a new form of life, new DNA, that is based on Shepard's current form - being both synthetic and organic. Each choice is color-coded with the colors: red, blue and green (respectively).<\/p><p>Regardless of choice, the mass relays are all destroyed, the Reapers leave Earth, and the Normandy crash-lands on an alien planet. Depending on Effective Military Strength (EMS), Earth can be destroyed, heavily damaged, or saved and some of the Normandy crew can be seen exiting the Normandy after it crash lands. If the 'destroy' ending is chosen, and the EMS is high enough, it's revealed that Shepard survived.<\/p><p>A post-credits sequence shows a man (stargazer) and a child looking up at the stars. The child asks if the story was really true, and the man confirms it but tells the child that some of the details may have been lost in time. He also states that it all happened a long time ago. The child inquires about going and seeing the stars for himself, and the man describes the galaxy as a billion stars, containing many worlds, and are all inhabited by different races and cultures. The child then asks the man to tell him another story about 'the Shepard'.<\/p><h2>DLC Packs<\/h2><h3>From Ashes<\/h3><p>At Eden Prime, Shepard, Liara and another squadmate found the last Prothean. Javik is a new squadmate when buying this dlc. It is avalible through the Collector's Edition or online.<\/p><h3>Extended Cut<\/h3><p>The ending of Mass Effect 3 was harshly received by a vocal segment of the game's fanbase. Common complaints regarding the ending reference a sudden, sharp decline in the level of narrative coherence, the introduction of the Catalyst as a character in the hologram form of the little boy whose death haunts Shepard over the course of the game, and an almost complete lack of player agency. The ending also does not take into account many of the choices that players made over the course of the trilogy; rather, it forces the player to choose between one of three possible solutions to the Reaper threat (Destroy, Control, Synthesis), the availability of which are dependent on the player's Galactic Readiness rating.<\/p><p>Bioware addressed the criticism by announcing that they would produce a downloadable update entitled \"Mass Effect 3: Extended Cut.\" Released on June 26, 2012, the free update adds material to all three endings in order to clarify at least some of the confusion and ambiguity. The player is also given new dialogue options during the meeting with the Catalyst to learn more about its motivations and history. The Extended Cut also offers a new, fourth ending, in which, at the player's choice, Commander Shepard can reject the Catalyst and the use of the Crucible. There is otherwise no new playable content included in the update, as the adjustments to the endings are all cinematic in nature.<\/p><h3>Leviathan<\/h3><p>Shepard was greeted by Dr. Garret Bryson to find legends and rumors about the Reapers. Shepard was told that a <a href=\"\/leviathans\/3015-7685\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7685\">Reaper-killer<\/a> is on the loose. Shepard found the trackings of the Leviathan on 2181 Desponia. Shepard talked with the Leviathan and learned that the Reapers were copies of the Leviathans. The Leviathans agreed to help Shepard but only for their race. Released in August 28, 2012.<\/p><h3>Omega<\/h3><p>At the Citadel, Aria was saying that Omega was stolen by Oleg Petrovsky. Shepard goes to Omega and met a Talon named Nyreen Kandros. Released in November 2012.<\/p><h4>Citadel<\/h4><p>At the Citadel, Shepard needed a long deserved break with old squadmates. It was interupted that a gang led by a Shepard clone wanted the real Shepard dead. Released in March 5, 2013.<\/p><h2>Xbox 360 Game Installation<\/h2><p>The installation greatly decreases loading times, and requires a total of 14.6 GB between two discs.<\/p><p>Disc one requires 7.6 GB, and disc two requires 7.0 GB.
