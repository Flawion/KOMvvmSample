## Goals

General goal is to make code readable and easy to understand without overwhelm architecture.

1. Keep style and conventions of Swift.
2. Use only the key frameworks.
3. Logical placement of files due to purpose.
4. Make logic and views separately, simplify the connections between them. But don't make the hell from interfaces connections, that makes everything hard to find.
5. Make logic easy to tests.
